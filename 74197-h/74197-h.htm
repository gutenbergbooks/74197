<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION.</h2>
</div>


<p>“Reuben Stone’s Discovery” forms the second
volume in the “Ship and Shore” Series. It tells, in a
matter-of-fact way, of the exploits of a young miller
who is left in charge of his father’s property while the
parent goes West to seek a more promising field for
business. A great number of things happen while the
youth is thus left to himself, and he is made to believe
several stories concerning his absent parent and the
mill property which cause him great uneasiness in
mind. Suspicious at last that all is not right, Reuben
starts out on a tour of investigation which places him
in more than one position of peril. But the lad never
falters, knowing he is doing what is right, and his triumph
at the end is fairly earned.</p>

<p>Reuben tells his own story, and does it in his own
peculiar way. Perhaps this method may not be altogether
satisfactory to older heads; but the success of
the first edition of the book had demonstrated the fact
that it is satisfactory to the boys, and it was for these
that the story was set to paper. If Reuben does some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
astonishing things throughout the course of the story,
it must be remembered that the lad was acting largely
in his father’s place, and that the world moves and
boys of to-day are full of energy.</p>

<small>THE YOUNG MILLER.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“It ain’t no use to talk, Rube, that bill has got to
be paid.” Mr. James Jackson brought his fist down on
the little desk in one corner of the mill with such
force that everything jumped. “I’ve waited for it
till I’m all out of patience, and now I want my
money.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Jackson,” I replied, “very sorry
indeed to keep you waiting; but it cannot be helped.
Business has been backward this summer, as you
know, and money is tight.”</p>

<p>“It never was tight when your father was here,”
growled the principal storekeeper of Torrent Bend,
as he strode up and down the whitened floor. “Every
bill was paid on the spot.”</p>

<p>“That is true, sir; but father knew the business
was getting poorer every day, and that is the reason he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
left to see if he couldn’t locate in some place in the
West.”</p>

<p>“Might better have stayed here and tended to this
place, and not let his son run it into the ground.”</p>

<p>“I am not running the business into the ground,”
I cried, with some show of spirit, because I thought
the assertion an unfair one. “I do all the grinding
that comes in, and even go over to Bayport and down
to Sander’s Point in the boat to get it.”</p>

<p>“Pooh! don’t tell me! Young men around here
don’t amount to much! But that ain’t here or there.
I came for that money.”</p>

<p>“I will see if I can pay it to-day. I have a load
of middlings to take over to Mr. Carnet this morning,
and if he pays me I will come right down to the Bend
and settle up.”</p>

<p>“And if he don’t pay?”</p>

<p>“I trust he does.”</p>

<p>“Well, pay or not, I’ve got to have my money,
and that’s all there is to it. You can’t have any more
goods till you square accounts.”</p>

<p>And having thus delivered himself, Mr. Jackson
stamped out of the mill, jumped into his buckboard,
and drove off for the village.</p>

<p>He did not leave me in a very happy state of mind.
I was in sole charge of the mill, and I was finding
it hard work to make everything run smoothly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span></p>

<p>Two months before, my father had departed for the
West, with a view to locating a new mill in any spot
that might promise well. Affairs in Torrent Bend
were nearly at a standstill, with no prospect of improving.</p>

<p>I was but sixteen years old, but I had been born
and raised in the mill, and I understood the business
fully as well as the average miller.</p>

<p>I ground out all the wheat, corn, rye, and buckwheat
that came to hand, took my portion of the same and
disposed of it to the best advantage. In addition to
this I used up all my spare time in drumming up
trade; and what more could any one do?</p>

<p>With the exception of my father, and an uncle
whom I had never seen, I was alone in the world.
My mother had died four years before, while I was
still attending the district school, and two years later
my twin sisters had followed her.</p>

<p>These deaths had been a severe blow to both my
father and myself. To me my mother had been all
that such a kind and loving parent can be, and my
sisters had been my only playmates.</p>

<p>My father and I were not left long to mourn. There
were heavy bills to be met, and we worked night and
day to get out of debt.</p>

<p>At length came the time when all was free and
clear, and we were nearly two hundred dollars ahead.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Then my father got it into his mind that he could
do better in some new Western place; and he left
to be gone at least three months.</p>

<p>For a time all worked smoothly. I had for a helper
a young man named Daniel Ford, a hearty, whole-souled
fellow, and we got along splendidly together;
but one night an accident happened.</p>

<p>The raceway to the mill was an old one, and a
heavy rain-storm increased the volume of water to
such an extent that it was partly carried away. I
had the damage repaired at once; but the cost was
such that it threw us once more into debt, and made
it necessary for me to purchase groceries from Mr.
Jackson on credit.</p>

<p>This I hated to do, knowing well the mean spirit
of the man. But his store was the only one on this
side of Rock Island Lake where my father was in
the habit of purchasing, and I had to submit.</p>

<p>“Humph! seems to me old Jackson is mighty sharp
after his money,” observed Ford, who was at work
in the mill, and had overheard our conversation.</p>

<p>“If Mr. Carnet pays up I won’t keep him waiting.”
I replied. “I suppose he’s entitled to his money.”</p>

<p>“If I was in your place I’d make him wait. I
wouldn’t take any such talk without making him suffer
for it. Do you want to load these bags on the
boat now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; sixteen of them.”</p>

<p>Getting out the wheelbarrow, the young fellow piled
it high with the bags of middlings, and carted them
down to the sloop that was tied to the wharf that
jutted out into the lake. It was only a short distance,
and the job was soon finished.</p>

<p>“Now I’m off,” I said, as I prepared to leave. “You
know what to do if anything comes in while I’m gone.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p>“And in the meanwhile you can get that flour ready
for Jerry Moore.”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>I jumped aboard the sloop, unfastened the painter,
hoisted the mainsail, and stood out for the other shore.
A stiff breeze was blowing, and I was soon well
underway.</p>

<p>Rock Island Lake was a beautiful sheet of water,
four miles wide by twelve long. Near its upper end
was a large island covered with rough rocks, bushes,
and immense pine-trees. On one side of it was the
thriving town of Bayport; and opposite, the village of
Bend Center, situated a mile below the Torrent Bend
River, which emptied into the lake at the spot where
my father had located his mill.</p>

<p>The two resident places were in sharp contrast to
each other. Bend Center was a sleepy spot that had
not increased in population for twenty years, while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
Bayport, which had been settled but fifteen years,
was all life and activity.</p>

<p>Among the attractions at the latter place were three
large summer hotels, now crowded with boarders.
The hotels were built upon the edge of the lake,
and boats on fishing and pleasure trips were to be
seen in all directions.</p>

<p>On this bright morning in midsummer the scene
was a pretty one, and had I felt in the humor I could
have enjoyed it thoroughly.</p>

<p>But I was out of sorts. As I have said, I was
doing my best to pay off what bills were due; and
to have Mr. Jackson, or, in fact, any one, insinuate
that I didn’t amount to much, and that my father
had made a mistake in trusting the business to me,
cut me to the heart.</p>

<p>I was but a boy, yet I was doing a man’s work,
and doing it as manfully as I knew how. I arose
every morning at five o’clock, and sometimes worked
until long after sundown.</p>

<p>I kept a strict account of what came in and went
out; and looking at the account-book now, I am
satisfied that I did as well as any one could have
done under the circumstances.</p>

<p>The work around the mill was hard, but I never
complained. I did fully as much as Ford, and if
at night my back ached as it never had before, no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
one ever heard me mention it, and I was always
ready for work on the following morning.</p>

<p>During the two months that had passed I had received
but three letters from my father. He was
out in South Dakota, and had not yet been able to locate
to his satisfaction. In his last communication
he had written that he was about to take a journey
to the north, and that I need not expect to hear from
him for two weeks or more.</p>

<p>This was somewhat of a disappointment; yet I
trusted the trip he was about to undertake would
be a fruitful one. The whole West was booming,
and why could we not participate in the fortunes
to be made?</p>

<p>As the sloop sped on its way I revolved the matter
over in my mind. So busy did I become with
my thoughts, I did not notice the freshening of the
wind until a sudden puff caught the mainsail, and
nearly threw the craft over on her side.</p>

<p>Springing up, I lowered the sheet, and then looked
to see if the cargo was still safe.</p>

<p>Luckily Ford had placed the bags tight up near
the cuddy, and not one had shifted. Seeing this, I
ran the sail up again, trimmed it, and stood on my
course.</p>

<p>As I did so I saw a large sloop not a great distance
ahead of me. It had all sails set, and was bowling
along at a lively rate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>I became interested in the large sloop at once.
By the manner in which she moved along I was certain
those in charge of her did not understand the
handling of such a craft. The mainsail and jib were
set full, and the boom of the former was sweeping
violently in the puffs of wind.</p>

<p>“On board the sloop!” I called out. “Why don’t
you take in some sail?”</p>

<p>“We can’t!” came back the answer. “The ropes
are all stuck fast.”</p>

<p>By this time I had come up to starboard of them.
I saw that there were two men, a woman, and a
little boy on board.</p>

<p>The two men were trying in vain to lower the sails.
They had evidently knotted the ropes when tying
them, and now they were so taut nothing could be
undone.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” called the elder of the two
men.</p>

<p>“If you can’t untie the knots, cut the rope,” I
called back, “and don’t lose any time about it.”</p>

<p>One of the men immediately started to follow out
my suggestion. I saw him draw out his pocket-knife,
open the blade, and begin to saw on the rope.</p>

<p>The next instant another puff of wind, stronger
than any of the others, came sweeping down the
lake. I was prepared for it, and sheered off to
windward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>But the puff caught the large sloop directly
broadside. The mainsheet and the jib filled, then the
craft careened, and before I could realize what was
happening, the four occupants were sent tumbling
out into the waters of the lake.</p>

<small>AT THE BANK.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I was both astonished and dismayed to see the
large sloop go over and precipitate its passengers
into the water. The catastrophe happened so
quickly that for a moment I knew not what to do.</p>

<p>Then my presence of mind came back, and I set
promptly to work to rescue those who had gone
overboard. In a moment I had the woman on board
of my own craft. She was insensible.</p>

<p>“Save my boy!” cried one of the men. “Don’t
mind us; we can both swim.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll do what I can,” was my reply.</p>

<p>Looking about, I discovered the body of the little
fellow some distance back. I tried to tack, but
it could not be done, the wind being too strong
from the opposite direction.</p>

<p>“He is going down!” went on the father in agonized
tones that pierced my heart. “Oh, save him!
save him!” And he made a strong effort to reach the
spot himself; but the weight of his clothes was against
him, and I knew he could not cover the distance before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
it would be too late. I was a first-class swimmer,
and in a second had decided what to do.</p>

<p>With a bang I allowed the mainsail to drop, and
threw over the anchor, which I knew would catch on
the rocky bottom twelve or fifteen feet below.</p>

<p>Then I kicked off my boots, ripped off my vest
and coat, and sprang to the stern. A single glance
showed me where the boy had just gone down, and
for this spot I dived head first.</p>

<p>I passed under the water some ten or a dozen feet.
When I came to the surface I found the little fellow
close beside me. He was kicking at a terrible
rate, and I could see he had swallowed considerable
of the fresh liquid of which the lake was constituted.</p>

<p>“Don’t kick any more,” I said; “I will save you.
Here, put your arms around my neck.”</p>

<p>“I want papa and mamma,” he cried, spitting out
some of the water.</p>

<p>“I’ll take you to them if you’ll do as I tell you.”</p>

<p>Thus reassured, the little fellow put his arms around
my neck. <a href="#i_fp016">I at once struck out for the sloop</a>, and
reaching it, clambered on deck. As I did so the
woman I had saved seemed to come to her senses,
and rising to her feet she clasped the boy in her
arms.</p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="i_fp016">
  <a href="#Page_17"><img src="images/i_fp016.jpg"
       alt="I at once struck out for the sloop" title=""></a>
</figure>

<p>“My Willie! my darling Willie!” she cried.
“Thank God you are saved!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, mamma; that big boy saved me. Wasn’t it
good of him?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, my child!”</p>

<p>Looking around, I discovered that the two men
were clinging to the keel of the large sloop, which
had now turned bottom upwards. I pulled up the
anchor, hoisted the sail again, and was soon alongside.</p>

<p>“Here you are!” I called out, throwing them a
rope by which they might come on board.</p>

<p>“Did you save my son?” demanded the elder one
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, William; he is safe,” returned the woman.</p>

<p>“All right; then we’ll come aboard too,” said the
man. “Here, Brown, you go first. This accident is
entirely my fault.”</p>

<p>“No more yours than mine,” returned the man
addressed, as he hauled himself up over the stern.
“It was I who wanted to go out without a man to
manage the boat, Mr. Markham.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I tied the knots in the ropes,” was the
reply, as the elder man also came on board.</p>

<p>They were all well-dressed people, and I rightly
guessed that they were boarders at one of the hotels
at Bayport.</p>

<p>“Well, young man, it was lucky you came along,”
said Mr. Markham, turning to me. “You have
saved at least two lives.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span></p>

<p>He was still excited, and put the case rather
strongly.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I didn’t!” I protested. “I only picked
you up. Any one would have done that.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you jump overboard and rescue my son?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes; but that wasn’t much to do.”</p>

<p>“I think it was a good deal. If my son had gone
down I would never have wanted to go back. All
of us owe you a deep debt of gratitude.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” burst out Mrs. Markham. “What
would I have done without my precious Willie?”
And she strained the little fellow to her breast.</p>

<p>The situation was both novel and uncomfortable
for me. I had but done my duty, and I didn’t see
the use of making such a fuss over it.</p>

<p>“Where are you bound?” I asked, by way of
changing the subject.</p>

<p>“We started for a trip down the lake about an
hour ago,” replied Mr. Markham. “Will you take
us back to Bayport?”</p>

<p>“Certainly; that is just where I am bound. But
what do you intend to do with your sloop?”</p>

<p>“Leave her adrift. I never want to see the craft
again.” And Mr. Markham shuddered.</p>

<p>“She can easily be righted,” I went on.</p>

<p>“If you want her, you may have her. I will pay
the present owner what she is worth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>“Thank you; I’ll accept her gladly,” I cried; “but
it won’t cost much to bring her around, and hadn’t
you better pay her owner for the damage done, and
let him keep her?”</p>

<p>“No; I’ve given her to you, and that’s settled.”</p>

<p>“Then let me thank you again, sir,” I said warmly,
greatly pleased at his generosity.</p>

<p>“Humph! it isn’t much. May I ask who you
are?”</p>

<p>“I am Reuben Stone. I run my father’s mill over
at Torrent Bend River.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Rather young to run a mill alone.”</p>

<p>“I have a man to help me. I was brought up
about the place.”</p>

<p>“I see. My name is William Markham. I am in
the dry-goods trade in New York. This is my wife
and my son Willie, and this is Mr. Brown, an intimate
friend.”</p>

<p>I acknowledged the various introductions as best
I could. Every one was wet, and scarcely presentable;
but in that particular we were all on a level,
and I did not feel abashed.</p>

<p>We were now approaching the Bayport shore, and
Mr. Markham asked me to stop at the hotel’s private
wharf, which I did.</p>

<p>“Will you come up to the hotel with us?” he
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not in condition,” I laughed. “I had better
be about my business.”</p>

<p>“No, no; I want you to stay here,” he returned
quickly. “I want to see you just as soon as I can
change my clothes.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I come back in half an hour?”</p>

<p>“That will suit me very well.”</p>

<p>After the party had landed I skirted the shore until
I came to the business portion of the town. Here I
tied up, and made my way at once to Mr. Carnet’s
flour and feed store.</p>

<p>“Well, Rube, got that middlings for me?” he exclaimed
as I entered.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; sixteen bags.”</p>

<p>“All right. Just pile them up in the shed on the
wharf. I’ll go down with you. How much?”</p>

<p>“I would rather you would see them before I set
a price,” I returned. “I am afraid some of the bags
are pretty wet.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want wet bags. How did it happen?”</p>

<p>I related what had occurred. By the time I had
finished we had reached the wharf.</p>

<p>“My! my!” exclaimed the flour-dealer. “Mr.
Markham! I know him. He is one of the richest
men at the Grand. So he said you could have the
boat. She is worth a couple of hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a hundred added. He is more than
generous.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>“He can afford it, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Here are the bags,” I went on. “Ten of them
are dry.”</p>

<p>“Those I’ll give you regular price for,—dollar and
a half.” Mr. Carnet examined the others. “Suppose
we make the six a dollar each?”</p>

<p>“Can’t you make it a dollar and a quarter?”</p>

<p>“No; a dollar is all they are worth to me.”</p>

<p>“Very well. When do you want more?”</p>

<p>“Any time next week,” replied the flour-merchant,
handing over the twenty-one dollars that were due me.</p>

<p>“All right. I’ll be over Tuesday. Want anything
else?”</p>

<p>“Not for the present. Trade is rather slow.”</p>

<p>Putting the money in my pocket-book, I entered
my sloop again, and steered for the hotel wharf. I
found Mr. Markham already awaiting me.</p>

<p>“Just tie up here and come with me,” he said.</p>

<p>I did so, and we walked along the principal street
of Bayport, which at this hour of the day was nearly
deserted.</p>

<p>“I am going to the bank on business,” he went on
with a twinkle in his eye. “This is my last day
here, and I want to draw out the deposit I made for
convenience’s sake when I came.”</p>

<p>I did not see what this had to do with me, but
said nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>We soon reached the bank, which, in contrast with
the many fine buildings in the place, was a dilapidated
structure. We entered the main office; and here Mr.
Markham asked me to wait while he held a brief
consultation with the president.</p>

<p>I waited for half an hour. During that time many
people came and went; but I knew none of them.
The janitor eyed me sharply, and finally asked me
what I wanted.</p>

<p>His tone was a rough one, and I replied curtly
that I was waiting for a gentleman who had gone
in to see the president; then I turned on my heel,
and walking outside, stood on the pavement. It was
not until some time later that I found out how
suspicious my actions had been regarded.</p>

<p>Presently Mr. Markham came down the steps in
a hurry. He was pale with anger, and his eyes
flashed with indignation.</p>

<p>“It is an outrage! an abominable outrage!” he
ejaculated.</p>

<p>I was rather surprised, and could not refrain from
asking what was the trouble.</p>

<p>“You would hardly understand it, Reuben,” he replied.
“I made a deposit in this bank under rather
peculiar circumstances, and now President Webster
refuses to allow me to draw the balance due me
until certain matters are adjusted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>“I hope you don’t lose by it.”</p>

<p>“I won’t lose much. But that isn’t the point.
I expected to reward you for what you have done for
me, and now I am not able to do so.”</p>

<p>“I don’t expect any reward, sir.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I shall do what is right.”</p>

<p>“The sloop is worth several hundred dollars. That
is more than I deserved.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. Every time I think of what
might have happened to my wife and my little son I
cannot help but shudder. Brown and I ought never
to have ventured out without a man to sail the boat.
We have learned a lesson that we shall not forget
in a hurry.”</p>

<p>“It was a risky thing to do in this wind, sir.”</p>

<p>“It was. But about this reward—”</p>

<p>“I don’t want any reward, sir. The value of the
sloop is more than I deserve.”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, you shall hear from me in the near
future.”</p>

<p>On this point Mr. Markham remained firm, and
a quarter of an hour later we parted, I hoping that
none of the party would suffer any from the involuntary
bath.</p>

<p>I jumped aboard the sloop, feeling on particularly
good terms with myself. As I sped away from Bayport
I began to calculate on what the large sloop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
would net me at a sale. Certainly not less than
two hundred and fifty dollars; and this would clear
off the bill for repairs at the mill, and leave me a
hundred dollars ahead. In my present straitened circumstances
this amount would be a perfect windfall.</p>

<p>I tried to steer for the overturned craft, and tow
her to a safe place, where I might right her and fix
her up.</p>

<p>The wind was as fresh as ever, and I had to steer
with care, lest the standing-room should get filled
with water from the waves that dashed over the bow.
To a person not used to the lake the passage would
have been a rough one, but I was accustomed to
far worse weather, and did not mind it.</p>

<p>At length I reached the spot where the catastrophe
had occurred, and looked around.</p>

<p>The large sloop had disappeared.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.<br>
<small>BAD NEWS.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>For a moment I could not believe the evidence
of my own eyes. I had fully expected to find the
large sloop in the spot I had left her, held there
by the anchor that must have fallen from the deck.
But she was gone, and a rapid survey of the surrounding
water convinced me that she was nowhere
within a quarter of a mile.</p>

<p>This discovery was a dismaying one; yet it did
not entirely dishearten me.</p>

<p>The sloop had probably drifted to the lower end of
the lake, somewhere near the Ponoco River, which
was its outlet. I would no doubt find her beached
in the vicinity of the south shore.</p>

<p>I at once turned and sped away in that direction.
The distance was about two miles, and in half an
hour I had covered it, and skirted the shore for a
considerable length.</p>

<p>The large sloop was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>I was now really worried. Was it possible that
some one had found the craft, and towed her off?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span></p>

<p>It seemed more than probable. The situation was
unpleasant, to say the least. The sloop was now
my property just the same as if I had purchased her,
and I did not like the idea of any one making off
with her, and then setting up a claim against me for
so doing.</p>

<p>I spent two hours in my search for the craft, but
without success. By this time it was well on in the
afternoon, and it became necessary for me to return
to the mill.</p>

<p>With something like a sigh, I tacked about, and
started on the return, resolved to continue the search
at daylight on the following day.</p>

<p>In sailing up the lake to the spot where the Torrent
Bend emptied, I had to pass Bend Center; and
I decided to tie up at the village, and settle up with
Mr. Jackson, who was so afraid I was going to cheat
him.</p>

<p>There was a trim harbor at this spot, and into this
I ran and lowered the mainsail.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Rube!” I suddenly heard some one call;
and looking up, I beheld Tom Darrow, an old fisherman
that I knew well, seated at the other end of
the pier, smoking his pipe.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Tom!” I returned. “Through work for
the day?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>“How’s the catch?”</p>

<p>“Pretty poor, Rube. Too windy for pickerel,”
returned Tom, as he arose and knocked some ashes
from the top of his pipe-bowl.</p>

<p>“I suppose it is.”</p>

<p>“Where have you been?” he went on, coming to
where I was tying up.</p>

<p>“Over to Bayport with a load of middlings.”</p>

<p>“That so? Thought I see you coming up the
lake.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been down looking for a sloop that capsized,”
I returned. “Did you see anything of her?”</p>

<p>“What kind of a sloop?”</p>

<p>“A large one, painted blue and white, and named
the Catch Me. I believe she used to belong to some
one in Bayport.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t see her; that is, I don’t think I did.
I saw some fellows towing something up the lake
about an hour ago. But I thought that was a raft.”</p>

<p>I was interested at once.</p>

<p>“Are you sure it was a raft?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; come to think of it, it didn’t look very
much like a raft, either. You see, it was out pretty
far, and I wasn’t paying much attention.”</p>

<p>“Who were the fellows?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. They had a pretty smart-looking
craft, but whose it was I couldn’t make out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>My heart sank at Tom Darrow’s words. I was
certain that the supposed raft was nothing less than
the Catch Me. The question was, what had the
men who found her done with her?</p>

<p>“What makes you so interested in the sloop?”
went on Tom curiously.</p>

<p>“She belongs to me, Tom.”</p>

<p>“What! Where did you ever raise money enough
to buy her?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t buy her; she was given to me.”</p>

<p>Tom Darrow was more taken aback than ever. I
enjoyed his amazement, and told my story.</p>

<p>“I declare, Rube, you’re quite a hero, and no mistake!”
cried the fisherman. “So he gave you the
sloop for the job? It was money easily earned.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t earned at all, Tom. But the question
is, what has become of the craft? Unless I find her
she won’t do me any good.”</p>

<p>“True enough; but you are sure to find her sooner
or later. She can’t leave the lake very well, and
all you’ve got to do is to keep your eyes open.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” I replied, shaking my
head. “They might change her rigging a bit, and
paint her over, and I would have a job recognizing
her.”</p>

<p>“So they might if they were sneaks enough to do
so; and I reckon some of them north-enders ain’t too
good to try it on. Tell you what I’ll do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to hunt her up for you.”</p>

<p>“Will you? I’ll pay you for your trouble, Tom.”</p>

<p>“Don’t want no pay, Rube. You’ve done me many
a good turn, and so did your father when he was
here. I’ll take a trip around the lake first thing to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“And so will I. Between the two of us we ought
to discover something.”</p>

<p>After this we arranged our plan. Darrow was to
start from the Bend, and go up the west shore, while
I was to come down from the mill, and investigate
along the east shore. At noon we were to meet
at Bayport and compare notes.</p>

<p>“By the way,” said he, when this matter was finished,
“heard from your father lately?”</p>

<p>“I expect a letter next week,” I replied. “He is
out in South Dakota. He hasn’t located yet.”</p>

<p>“Hope he strikes it rich when he does,” concluded
Darrow. “No man in these parts deserves it more.”</p>

<p>Leaving the pier, I made my way to Mr. Jackson’s
store, which, as I have said, was the largest at the
Bend.</p>

<p>I found the merchant behind the counter, weighing
out sugar.</p>

<p>“Well, have you come to settle up?” he asked
shortly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>“I have come to pay some on account,” I replied.</p>

<p>“How much?”</p>

<p>“Twenty-one dollars.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you pay the whole bill of twenty-four,
and be done?”</p>

<p>“Because I haven’t so much. Some of the middlings
I sold Mr. Carnet got wet, and I had to make
a reduction.”</p>

<p>“Humph! Well, hand over the money. Every
little helps. But I can’t trust out any more goods
till the entire amount is settled.”</p>

<p>And Mr. Jackson placed twenty-one dollars in the
drawer, and gave me credit on his books.</p>

<p>I walked out somewhat downcast. I had wanted
several things in the shape of groceries, and with no
money to purchase them what was I to do?</p>

<p>As I walked down the one street of the village,
I passed the post-office. Mr. Sandon, the post-master,
was at the window, and he tapped for me to
come in.</p>

<p>“A letter just came for you,” he said. And he
went behind the counter and handed it over.</p>

<p>For an instant my heart gave a bound of pleasure
as I thought it must be a letter from my father;
then I saw that the handwriting was strange, and I
opened the epistle, wondering what it could contain.</p>

<p>It was dated at Huron, South Dakota, and ran as
follows:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Nephew Reuben</span>,—You will no doubt be very
much surprised to hear from an uncle whom you have never
seen, but circumstances make it necessary that I should address
this letter to you. I wish that my first lines to my nephew
might be brighter, but our wishes cannot always be fulfilled, and
we must bear up bravely under all trials that come to us.</p>

<p>Hear, then, the sad news that your father is dead. He lost his
life by falling down a deep ravine on the morning of the 10th
instant. We were out prospecting for a good mill location, and
he slipped, and, before I could come to his aid, plunged headlong
to the bottom. When I reached him he was unconscious, and
lived but a short hour after. I am now arranging to have him
buried to-morrow, and shall then follow this letter to Bend Center,
to take charge of his affairs.</p>

<p>As you perhaps know, I met your father in Chicago. I loaned
him quite a sum of money, and we went to South Dakota together.
But of this and other important matters we will speak when we
meet, which will be shortly after you receive this letter.</p>

<p class="noic">Affectionately your uncle,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Enos Norton</span>.<br></p>

<p>P.S. I would not speak of money matters in such a letter
as this, but I cannot afford to lose that which I have advanced.
I trust the mill is in good running order.</p>
</div>

<p>I could hardly finish the communication. I became
so agitated that all the lines seemed to run into each
other. Mr. Sandon noticed how I was disturbed.</p>

<p>“Anything wrong, Rube?” he asked kindly.</p>

<p>“My father is dead!” I gasped out, and sank down
on a box completely overcome.</p>

<small>MR. ENOS NORTON.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>For a long time I sat on the box in the little village
post-office. I could think of nothing but that
my father was dead.</p>

<p>The shock of the news, coming as it did so unexpectedly,
completely staggered me. The only parent
that had been left to me was gone, and I was left
to fight the battle of life alone.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad, Rube; that’s a fact,” said Mr. Sandon,
laying his hand on my shoulder. “What ailed him?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. He met with an accident,” I replied,
struggling hard with the lump that seemed bound to
rise in my throat. “He fell over a ravine while looking
for a place to locate a mill. You can read the
letter if you wish.”</p>

<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>Mr. Sandon adjusted his spectacles, and read the
letter carefully. While he did so I sat with my
head buried in my hands, trying to hide the tears
that would not stop flowing.</p>

<p>“This is from your Uncle Enos Norton, I see,”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
he went on. “I thought Enos Norton was dead long
ago.”</p>

<p>“I have never seen him,” I replied.</p>

<p>“He used to be around these parts years ago when
he was a young man; but he got a sudden notion
to go West, and he went. He loaned your father
some money, it appears.”</p>

<p>“So he says. I don’t know what for. Father
took enough along to pay his expenses,” I returned
despondently.</p>

<p>“Maybe he made a venture of some kind or another.
A man is apt to risk more when he strikes
a new country.”</p>

<p>I made no reply to this remark. My heart was
too full for further talk, and leaving the post-office
I walked slowly back to my boat.</p>

<p>If the prospect before had been gloomy it was now
worse. The pang over the news of my father’s death
overshadowed everything else; yet I could not help
but remember that my uncle was soon to arrive, and
that my father’s estate was indebted to him for
money loaned.</p>

<p>Entering my sloop, I was soon on the way to Torrent
Bend River. The wind was still fresh, and I
skirted the shore rapidly, arriving in sight of the
mill at sundown.</p>

<p>Ford stood at the door awaiting me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<p>“Been a little longer than you expected,” he said.
“Anything wrong?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dan; everything is wrong,” I replied.
“Read that letter.”</p>

<p>He did so; and somehow it was a comfort to see
his eyes grow moist.</p>

<p>“Dead!” he exclaimed, and then he caught me by
the shoulder. “Rube, I can’t say how sorry I am
for you; there ain’t words strong enough to tell it.”
And without another word he led me into the mill.</p>

<p>We passed a rather silent evening. Ford was in
the habit of leaving as soon as the day’s work was
over, but that night he remained. He was the first
up in the morning, and when I came down I found
breakfast already prepared.</p>

<p>“Come, Rube, have a strong cup of coffee,” he
said. “I know you haven’t slept a wink. I hardly
got a nap myself, thinking matters over. Do you
know anything about this uncle that’s coming?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but that he was my mother’s brother.”</p>

<p>“He seems to be mighty anxious about his money,”
went on the mill-hand, who was always outspoken in
his opinions.</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose he is entitled to what is due him.”</p>

<p>“He might have waited till he got here. Wonder
when he will arrive?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<p>I was utterly cast down, and could not do a stroke
of work. I took a walk up the river, and sat
down on a rock to think the whole matter over.</p>

<p>It was two hours later before I rose to go back.
The time had been a bitter one; but now I felt better,
and was ready to face whatever was to come.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the mill I found Ford hard at
work. Tom Darrow had just tied up at the pier,
and my helper had told him the sad news.</p>

<p>“It’s hard, Rube, dreadful hard, and no mistake,”
he said.</p>

<p>Later on he told me he had sailed around the
lake, and into many of the coves, but had seen no
trace of the Catch Me. I was sorry to hear this,
but in the light of the greater calamity I hardly gave
the matter any attention.</p>

<p>“I suppose you didn’t think to get them things
you spoke on?” observed Ford when the fisherman
was gone.</p>

<p>“What things?” I asked.</p>

<p>“The groceries you were going to get down to
Jackson’s.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t let me have them. He said I
would have to settle up in full before I could have
anything more.”</p>

<p>“The miserly chump!” exclaimed Ford; “and after
you paying him hundreds of dollars! I wouldn’t patronize
him any more!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t intend to.” I paused for a moment.
“Dan, I am in a bad fix all around. I haven’t any
money, and we need things. I don’t know how I
am going to pay you your wages next Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let that worry you, Rube; I can get
along.”</p>

<p>“But that’s not the point. It isn’t fair to ask you
to wait,” I went on earnestly.</p>

<p>“I ain’t starving,” he laughed. “I’ve got some
little saved. Besides, when you find the Catch Me,
she’ll be worth at least a couple of hundred dollars
to you.”</p>

<p>“That’s so; but I imagine finding her will be a
bigger job than I thought it would be. I am satisfied
that some one has towed her off, and has got her
in hiding.”</p>

<p>There was quite a bit of grinding to do at the
mill, and after a dinner of which I hardly ate a
mouthful, I started in to help Ford do the work.</p>

<p>It was the best possible thing I could undertake;
for it diverted my mind, and that eased my heart,
which felt at times like a big lump of lead in my
breast.</p>

<p>As I tended to the hoppers and helped fill the
bags I began to speculate upon what kind of a man
my uncle would prove to be. The tone of his letter,
as I read it over again, did not exactly satisfy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
me. What did he mean by stating that he intended
to take charge of affairs?</p>

<p>At five o’clock I heard the sound of a horn coming
from the main road that ran from Harborport
through the Bend to Kannassee, ten miles distant.</p>

<p>“There’s the horn of the stage-coach,” said Ford.
“Bart Pollock must want to see you.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s after some feed,” I replied. “I’ll
go down and see.”</p>

<p>Brushing the flour from my face and hands, I left
the mill on a run. The main road was fifteen rods
away through the bushes. There was a rough path
but little used, and this I followed.</p>

<p>When I arrived I found the stage-coach standing
in the middle of the road, with Bart Pollock, the
driver, sitting contentedly on the front seat along
with a tall stranger.</p>

<p>“Here I am, Bart!” I sang out. “What’s wanted?”</p>

<p>“Hullo, Rube! Nothin’s wanted. Here’s a visitor
to see you,—your uncle, all the way from Western
parts.”</p>

<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>I stopped short to look at the man as he hopped
to the ground. He was slimly built, with a thin,
sharp face, and cold gray eyes. He carried a hand-satchel,
and this he swung from his right to his left
hand as he came forward to greet me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>“So this is my nephew Reuben?” he said in a
high voice, as we shook hands. “I suppose you’ve
been expecting me?”</p>

<p>“Not quite so soon,” I replied. “I thought you’d
come in a day or two, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, I made first-class time. The train left half
an hour after the funeral was over, and I didn’t see
no use in hanging around any longer. I settled all
the bills beforehand. They were mighty high too.
A hundred and twenty-five dollars for the coffin
and carriage, and fifty dollars for the ground, besides
twenty-five for the undertaker, which brings
the whole up to two hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>By this time the stage-coach was on its way again,
and we were left standing alone.</p>

<p>“Tell me about my father,” I said. “I want to
know all about how the awful thing happened.”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t be so fast, Reuben; there’s lots of
time. Wait till I’ve had supper, and got rested up
a bit. Traveling don’t seem to agree with me. How
are things at the mill?”</p>

<p>“Rather slow, sir.”</p>

<p>“What! you must be fooling!”</p>

<p>“No, I am not. Trade all around has been slack
this summer.”</p>

<p>“Humph! That must be because you are only a
boy. Just you wait till I get to managing things,
then I guess business will hum.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>“I do the best I can,” I replied, not liking to be
talked to in this fashion.</p>

<p>“Of course, of course; but then you’re nothing
but a boy, and a boy can’t do half as well as a man.”</p>

<p>“I am doing as well as any one in these parts. I
go ’way over to Bayport for orders.”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton started slightly.</p>

<p>“Bayport?” he queried.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, that ain’t very far.”</p>

<p>“It is farther than father used to go.”</p>

<p>“Well, your father wasn’t any great hand for business,
I guess.”</p>

<p>“Father was always ready to do his best,” I returned
warmly, not liking the manner in which my
father’s character had been assailed. “He was not
responsible for the dull times here.”</p>

<p>“Maybe; but business is just what a man makes it.”</p>

<p>“Are you a miller, sir?”</p>

<p>“No, I ain’t; but I guess it won’t take a man
like me long to learn the business.”</p>

<p>I had my doubts concerning the truth of the last
assertion. I had been around a mill all my life, and
yet there was hardly a day passed but what some
new difficulty presented itself.</p>

<p>“You see, I’m a self-made man,” went on Mr. Norton.
“I left home long before my sister Mary had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
married your father. I went out to Chicago, and all
the money I have I made there without help from
any one.”</p>

<p>“Are you rich?” I ventured.</p>

<p>“Oh, no; but I’m comfortable,—that is, I will be
when I get back the money I loaned your father.”</p>

<p>“Father couldn’t have borrowed much.”</p>

<p>“What?” cried Mr. Norton. “That is all you know
about it. He came to me pretty often; and that
money, added to the funeral expenses, made a good
round sum.”</p>

<p>“How much?” I asked faintly.</p>

<p>“All told, it’s just six hundred and fifty dollars,”
was the reply.</p>

<small>HOT WORDS.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I cannot say that my first impression of Mr.
Enos Norton was a favorable one. His manner was
domineering, and evidently he intended to conduct
matters to suit himself.</p>

<p>He knew nothing at all about running a mill, yet
he expected to take sole charge. This, to say the
least, was peculiar.</p>

<p>His assertion that my father’s estate was indebted
to him to the amount of six hundred and fifty dollars
astonished and dismayed me. What had my parent
done with the greater part of this? and how was I
ever to settle up?</p>

<p>The mill property as it now stood was not worth
over twelve hundred dollars, and at a forced sale it
was not likely that it would bring half that sum.
How, then, was his claim to be met? and, when all
was settled, what was to become of me?</p>

<p>By the time I had asked myself these questions
we had reached the mill. Here I introduced Ford,
and the three of us entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>“Not such a good place as I expected to find,”
remarked Mr. Norton, examining first one thing and
then another. “You don’t seem to keep things in
very good order.”</p>

<p>“We keep them in as good order as possible. Many
of the things are worn so much that they cannot be
repaired,” I replied.</p>

<p>“And it takes work to fix things up,” he added,
with a hard look.</p>

<p>I did not reply, and I saw Ford toss his head.</p>

<p>“Well, let us go into the house part,” went on
Mr. Norton. “I’m fearfully hungry. Got anything
good?”</p>

<p>“I can give you some fried fish, bread and butter,
and some blackberries,” I said, as I led the way into
the living-room.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you got no coffee?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Then those things will do first rate. I’m fearfully
hungry. Didn’t have a mouthful since this
morning. Make the coffee good and strong.”</p>

<p>“I will, Mr. Norton.”</p>

<p>“Don’t call me Mr. Norton. I’m your Uncle Enos.”</p>

<p>“All right, Uncle Enos; I’ll try to remember.”</p>

<p>I went into the cook-shed, and began to prepare
supper. I did not feel in good-humor, and my face
must have shown it, for when Ford came in he remarked,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“Your uncle ain’t going to play second, fiddle to
nobody, is he?”</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders without replying. The
prospects ahead were not very bright.</p>

<p>Presently I had to go into the living-room to get
some spices out of the pantry. I found Mr. Norton
in the act of taking a deep pull from a small black
flask.</p>

<p>“My blackberry brandy,” he said, by way of an explanation.
“I have to take it for a weak stomach.”</p>

<p>“Are you sickly?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Somewhat.”</p>

<p>I went out again; but through the crack of the
door I saw him take another pull at the flask, and
then put it in his pocket.</p>

<p>This was another action that I did not like. About
the Bend were a number of men who spent every
cent of their money for drink, and this had led me
to become strictly temperate.</p>

<p>At length the meal was ready, and I set it on the
table, and called in Ford. We sat down, and Mr.
Norton helped himself to a liberal portion.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take hold?” he asked, seeing that
I scarcely touched a thing.</p>

<p>“I don’t feel like eating,” I replied. “I am waiting
to hear about my father.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, then, I’ll give you the whole story. We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
started out from Hamner’s Gulch one bright morning
to go up what is known as the Black Hawk Ravine.
Your father had an idea that he could set up a saw-mill
there if a grinding-mill didn’t pay.”</p>

<p>“He never said anything about a saw-mill to me,”
I put in.</p>

<p>“Your father was a very queer man,” said Mr. Norton.
“Did he say anything about me in his letters,
or about the money he borrowed?”</p>

<p>“Not a word.”</p>

<p>“I thought so. Guess he was ashamed of the money
he let fly, traveling to this place and that, and paying
a holding price down on half a dozen spots, and then
letting them go.”</p>

<p>“But about the journey?” I said, anxious to get
back to the particulars of my father’s death, which
just now interested me more than anything else.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes! Well, we started out for the ravine,
and we reached it about two o’clock in the afternoon.
It was a wild spot, and I was for going back; but
your father wanted to go ahead, and he did so, I
following.”</p>

<p>“And was that where he lost his life?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. He was ahead, and by six o’clock it
was getting dark. I called out to him to be careful,
as we were then walking along a narrow ledge, and
far below was a mountain torrent, ten times worse
than this one you have here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span></p>

<p>“And this was the ledge he fell over?”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton nodded.</p>

<p>I shuddered. In imagination I could see my father
going over, and clutching out vainly to save himself.
It was a horrible thought.</p>

<p>“Yes, he went over. It was no use to try to save
him, though I did spring forward. He went down,
and struck on his head.”</p>

<p>“You went after him at once?”</p>

<p>“Of course; as quick as I could. He was alive yet,
but he didn’t live very long; just long enough to settle
up his private matters, and put me in charge of his
affairs.”</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p>“He made me write it out on a bit of paper, and
then he signed it. I didn’t want to do it, but he said
I was his only relative, and I must.”</p>

<p>“Then he wanted you to take entire charge of his
affairs?” I asked.</p>

<p>“That’s it. In other words, I was to become your
guardian, Reuben.”</p>

<p>My heart sank at these words. As I have said, I
did not take to my newly arrived relative from the
start, and it was not a pleasant thought that in future
he was to have full power over me. I heartily
wished that my twenty-first birthday was at hand.</p>

<p>“I take it your father wasn’t no great business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
man,” went on Mr. Norton, helping himself to more
fish and another cup of coffee. “The state of affairs
here shows that he wasn’t. He would have done better
by remaining here than by going West as he did.”</p>

<p>This was not the first time that this man had said
things derogatory to my father’s memory, and it made
me angry.</p>

<p>“I think my father knew his own business best,”
I cried. “He knew all about milling, and you don’t
know a thing.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me in this style,” cried Mr. Norton,
turning quickly. “What I’ve said I’ll stick to; your
father was no business man. He didn’t know how to
manage.”</p>

<p>“He certainly made a mistake when he appointed
you my guardian,” I replied pointedly.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton turned pale.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I mean just what I say.”</p>

<p>“You don’t like the idea of my being set over you,
eh?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’ll have to get used to it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I ever shall. I could never like
any one who spoke of my father in the style you
have done.”</p>

<p>“Hoity-toity! That is all boy’s talk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>“I mean it.”</p>

<p>“Well, like me or not, you must remember that I
am now in charge of everything. I shall expect you
hereafter to do as I say.”</p>

<p>To this I did not reply. I looked at Ford, and
saw that his lip was curled up. Evidently he did not
like Mr. Enos Norton any more than I did.</p>

<p>“You have been having things here your own way
too long. You have let the business go to the dogs,
and all that sort of thing. Now all this has got to
be stopped. I have got to get back my six hundred
and fifty dollars, and then I have got to get what remains
into shape, and invest it for your future good.
How does your bank account stand at present?” and
Mr. Norton stopped eating to hear my answer.</p>

<p>I paused before replying.</p>

<p>“Did you hear me?” he added. “How much
money have you got in the bank?”</p>

<p>“Not a cent,” I returned. And somehow it gave
me pleasure to say so.</p>

<p>“Not a cent! Come, I want the truth.”</p>

<p>“I have told the truth. We have no bank account.”</p>

<p>“Well, then, how much money have you on hand?”</p>

<p>“Not a dollar.”</p>

<p>“You mean that?”</p>

<p>“If I didn’t I wouldn’t say so. Business is bad,
and I have all I can do to make both ends meet.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
I took in twenty-one dollars yesterday, and paid it
out on account a few hours afterwards.”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton sank back in his chair. I could see
that his hopes had had a great fall. Evidently he
had expected me to mention quite a round sum.</p>

<p>“Then how do you expect to pay me my six hundred
and fifty dollars?” he demanded after a spell of
silence.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“I laid out the money, and I expect it back.”</p>

<p>“Well, as you have charge of my father’s affairs,
you must get it back the best way you can,” I replied
briefly.</p>

<p>“None of your impudence!”</p>

<p>“I am not impudent. I haven’t any money, and
there is no money here belonging to father; that’s
all there is to it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton jumped up from his chair and strode
about the room.</p>

<p>“You are lying to me!” he cried passionately.</p>

<p>“I tell the truth.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe a word of it,” he went on. “Your
father had money, and either you have spent it, or else
you intend to keep it from me. Now, I am going to
know the truth.”</p>

<p>As Mr. Norton concluded he walked over to the corner,
and caught up a hickory stick that stood behind
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span></p>

<p>“What do you intend to do?” I cried, as he advanced
upon me.</p>

<p>“I am going to give you your first lesson in telling
the truth,” he replied.</p>

<p>“You shall not touch me with that stick!”</p>

<p>“I will. You shall learn to mind me, and that the
very first thing.”</p>

<p>And with these words Mr. Norton rushed on me,
and grabbed me by the collar.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.<br>
<small>AT ROCK ISLAND.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I could hardly believe that Mr. Norton intended
to strike me. I had not been struck for a long time;
in fact, as far back as I could remember, and I did
not intend to submit.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when the man caught me by the collar,
I jerked away as quickly as possible, and put the
table between us.</p>

<p>This seemed to enrage him still more, and he fairly
leaped the distance, caught me again, and bore me to
the floor.</p>

<p>“We’ll see if you are going to mind or not!” he
cried.</p>

<p>“Let me up!” I screamed.</p>

<p>“Yes, let him up,” put in Ford. “I won’t have
you thrashing Rube.”</p>

<p>And he caught Mr. Norton by the arm, and pulled
him in such a fashion that he went sprawling on
his back.</p>

<p>My tormentor was completely astonished by this
movement. He scrambled to his feet, and I lost no
time in doing the same.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean by interfering?” demanded
Mr. Norton, turning a livid face to the mill-hand.</p>

<p>“I won’t stand by and see Rube abused,” retorted
Ford.</p>

<p>“It’s none of your business!”</p>

<p>“I’ll make it my business.”</p>

<p>“You’ll do no such a thing!” howled Mr. Norton.
“I won’t have such a fellow as you about the
place. You are discharged.”</p>

<p>“I am willing. I wouldn’t want to work here if
you are to be the boss. But I’m Rube’s friend, and
I’m going to stick up for him. Nice kind of a man
you are, raising a fight when you haven’t been here
but a few hours! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
If I told folks down to the Bend about the
way you carry on, they’d ride you on a rail.”</p>

<p>Ford was in for easing his mind, and I let him
go on.</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!” cried Mr. Norton. “I won’t listen
to a word.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you will,” went on Ford. “Here is
Rube just about heard of his father’s death, and you
treating him in this fashion! You haven’t got a heart
as big as a toad. Besides, the boy has told you the
truth.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” asked the man, somewhat
abashed by the fact that Ford did not back down.
“His father must have been worth something.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>“Well, he wasn’t; and in these times it’s hard to
make a living at anything in Bend Center. I’ve
looked around and I know.”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton was silent for a moment; then his manner
appeared to change. He threw the stick into the
corner, and sat down on a chair.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I was a little hard,” he admitted; “but
I was led to believe that Stone was rich, otherwise I
would never have loaned him the money I did.”</p>

<p>No one made any reply to this, and he went on,—</p>

<p>“Sit down, Reuben; I won’t touch you. I didn’t
think you had just got the bad news. It’s over a week
old to me.”</p>

<p>“I got your letter last evening.”</p>

<p>“Yes? I suppose it was enough to upset you.
Come, we will let things run along as they have been
for a few days. You won’t find me hard to get on
with after you once know me.”</p>

<p>I had my doubts about this, but decided to keep
them to myself. We finished the meal in silence,
and then Ford beckoned me out into the mill-room.</p>

<p>“Do you want me to stay with you to-night?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Won’t it be too much of an inconvenience?”</p>

<p>“Not at all. I’ll go down to the house, and let
the folks know, and then come right back.”</p>

<p>“If you do you’ll have to sleep with me, for I’ll
have to give the spare bed to Mr. Norton,” I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span></p>

<p>“I won’t mind that if you don’t,” replied the mill-hand.</p>

<p>So the matter was settled. If Mr. Norton heard of
it he did not say anything, and for the remainder of
the evening things ran smoothly.</p>

<p>Before we retired I had learned many things that
are not necessary to repeat here. Mr. Norton told of
how he and my father had met in Chicago, how my
father had begged of him to advance him money from
time to time, and how the two had started together
for South Dakota. He was a fluent talker, and I grew
quite interested, though I did not exactly believe all
that was told me.</p>

<p>We were all up early the next morning, and Ford
and I prepared breakfast. Before eating, Mr. Norton
applied himself again to the bottle, and asked the
mill-hand if there was a good tavern at the Bend;
to which Ford replied that there was a tavern, but
whether good or bad he did not know, as he had never
stopped there.</p>

<p>“Got any grinding to do?”</p>

<p>“Enough to keep us running till noon.”</p>

<p>“And after that?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to wait for something to come in,” I
replied.</p>

<p>“Then, Ford, we can get along without you,” continued
Mr. Norton. “In the future Reuben and I will
do all the work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span></p>

<p>“All right,” said the mill-hand, seeing that there was
nothing else to be done. “How about my wages?”
and he winked at me.</p>

<p>“How much is coming to you?”</p>

<p>“Eight dollars.”</p>

<p>“Reuben, have you the money?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; as I said before, I haven’t a dollar.”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton thought for a moment, and then got out
his pocket-book.</p>

<p>“Here you are,” he said. “Give me a receipt. I
will have to charge the amount against the estate.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t want it,” said Ford. “I’m not going
to rob Rube of what little is coming to him.”</p>

<p>“Take it, Dan,” I said. “You’ve earned it.” And
I compelled him to put the money in his pocket.</p>

<p>Then the receipt was written out, and this Mr.
Norton placed carefully in his notebook.</p>

<p>“Now we are done with you,” he said. “If I ever
need you in the future I will send Reuben for you.
I suppose you never thought of buying the mill, did
you?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got the money,” replied Ford.</p>

<p>“The reason I asked is because the place may be
up for sale,” went on Mr. Norton; “if so, it ought
to be a pretty good investment for you.”</p>

<p>“It might be,” said Ford.</p>

<p>A little later he went off, and Mr. Norton and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
were left alone. I set to work with a will, and he
stood around watching me.</p>

<p>“That’s easy enough,” he said, as I fed the grain
into the hoppers. “I should think almost any one
could do that.”</p>

<p>“Feeding is easy enough, but there are a good
many other things to learn, as you will soon see.”</p>

<p>A little later Mr. Norton took a walk around the
outside of the place. He was gone fully an hour,
and when he came back he appeared to be quite
uneasy.</p>

<p>“Do you need anything from the village?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“We need a number of groceries,” I replied. “I
wanted to get them day before yesterday, but Mr.
Jackson wouldn’t let me have them until I settled
up in full. I owe him three dollars yet.”</p>

<p>“Well, you had better go down and get those groceries
now. Let this grinding go till this afternoon
or to-morrow. I want you to get me some—some
tobacco.”</p>

<p>“I will have to pay for all I get.”</p>

<p>“Well, I will give you the money. Will two
dollars do?”</p>

<p>“I need but a dollar.”</p>

<p>“Then here is a dollar and a quarter. Get me a
quarter’s worth of plug-cut smoking. You needn’t<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
hurry about getting back. Seeing what you’ve got
on your mind you need a rest.”</p>

<p>In ten minutes I was off in the sloop. Mr. Norton
seemed to be very anxious to have me go, but for
what reason I could not determine.</p>

<p>“And remember you needn’t hurry back,” he called
out as I hoisted the mainsail and stood off from the
shore; “if any orders come in I will attend to them.”</p>

<p>As I moved down the shore toward the Bend I
reviewed my strange situation. How much had happened
in the last forty-eight hours!</p>

<p>I was far from satisfied with Mr. Norton—somehow
I could not call him my uncle. I had expected
my mother’s brother to be a different kind of a man.
He would evidently make a hard guardian, and I
was sure that for me there were many breakers ahead.</p>

<p>As the sloop skimmed along far enough from the
shore to catch the full benefit of the breeze that
was blowing, I espied another craft anchored in a
little cove a quarter of a mile below the mill.</p>

<p>She was a stranger to me, and I wondered who
owned her, and why her master had stopped at the
spot, which was a rocky one, full of thorny bushes.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had come for some geological specimens,
which the visitors at Bayport were frequently after.
The region was full of all kinds of stone, and I
knew it was quite a fad to study them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span></p>

<p>I passed the craft, and continued on the way to
Bend Center, arriving there in the middle of the
forenoon.</p>

<p>I found that the news of my father’s death had
been widely circulated, and nearly every one I met
came forward to extend a sympathy that went straight
to my heart.</p>

<p>I did not go to Mr. Jackson’s store, but to the
“opposition,” as it is called in such places. This
was kept by Mr. Frank Lewis, a young man, and
one whom I found very obliging.</p>

<p>It did not take me long to make my purchases.
As I turned to go back to the boat I came face
to face with Tom Darrow.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Rube!” he exclaimed. “Well, this is
lucky! You’re the fellow I want to see.”</p>

<p>“What about?” I asked. “Have you found the
sloop?”</p>

<p>“Come with me and I’ll tell you,” he replied.</p>

<p>And he led the way out of the store, and down to
the pier.</p>

<p>“I ain’t found the sloop, Rube, but I’ve found out
something about her.”</p>

<p>“What have you found out, Tom?” I questioned,
as my heart gave a bound.</p>

<p>“I overheard three men talking about some sloop
they had picked up,” went on the old fisherman.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
“They stopped talking as soon as they saw I was
around. I reckon they want to scoop the prize for
themselves.”</p>

<p>“Who were the men?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know two of them; the other was Andy
Carney. You know him?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he is one of the tough fishermen from the
north end. What do you suppose the three have done
with the boat?”</p>

<p>“Taken her up to one of the coves at Rock Island.
If I was you I’d sail up and take a look around.”</p>

<p>“I will,” I replied.</p>

<p>“I’d go along, only I can’t spare the time,” said
Darrow.</p>

<p>Five minutes later I was on board my sloop, and
speeding for Rock Island in search of the Catch Me,
which I was now certain had been stolen.</p>

<p>The large sloop had become my property, and as the
craft was worth at least three hundred dollars it is
no wonder that I was anxious to find her. The sum
of money represented a good deal to me, especially in
my present situation.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton, my newly appointed guardian, had told
me to take my time about getting back to the mill, so
I considered that I had at least several hours of my
own before me. This was long enough, I calculated,
to take a run up to Rock Island, make an investigation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
and get back to the mouth of the Torrent Bend
River.</p>

<p>I let the mainsail out full, and also the jib. This
was all the small sloop could carry in the present
wind, and even then I found I had a lively time whenever
it came to changing the tack.</p>

<p>I stowed away the stuff I had bought in the cuddy,
where it would not get wet, and then took things easy
in the stern-sheets.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful day, and had my mind been free
I would have enjoyed the outing thoroughly. But
the clouds of sorrow and perplexity were upon me,
and I paid scant attention to the fair blue sky above
and the rippling water beneath.</p>

<p>At length I came within a quarter of a mile of the
island, and then began to keep my eyes wide open for
whatever might come to view.</p>

<p>Rock Island was half a mile wide by nearly a mile
long, and on all sides were a number of coves and
inlets, some well hidden by the masses of bushes and
trees that grew along the shores.</p>

<p>I decided to make my investigation as systematic
as possible, knowing that it would be folly to sail
about in a haphazard fashion. I ran into the first
cove I came to, looked around in every direction, and
continued this until I had visited the entire south and
east shores.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<p>By this time it was midday. I was hungry, for a
breeze on the water is calculated to sharpen up almost
any one’s appetite. I had a lunch in the locker,
and this I munched as the sloop sped along to the
north shore.</p>

<p>Suddenly I saw, or fancied I saw, a speck of white
in the bushes some distance ahead. I tacked in the
direction, and presently distinguished the mast of some
vessel standing out straight among the crooked trees
that lined a long and narrow inlet.</p>

<p>Satisfied that I had made a discovery of importance,
I lowered the jib and took several reefs in the
mainsail. The wind carried me directly into the
opening, and here I dropped anchor.</p>

<p>“Hullo, there! What do you want here?”</p>

<p>It was a rough voice that hailed me, and looking
around I beheld a rougher-looking man standing on
the shore, not ten feet away from me.</p>

<p>It was Andy Carney, the fellow Darrow had mentioned
to me. He carried a gun, and his manner
was one of astonishment and anger.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.<br>
<small>A PITCHED BATTLE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I was astonished to find myself face to face with
Andy Carney, whom I knew to be one of the toughest
characters that infested the north shore of Rock
Island Lake.</p>

<p>But if the meeting was unexpected for me, it was
equally so for him, for after hailing me he stood
still for a moment; and in that space of time I had
a chance to recover.</p>

<p>“I say, what do you want here?” he repeated,
seeing that I did not answer him.</p>

<p>“I was looking for a sloop that capsized on the
lake a couple of days ago,” I returned.</p>

<p>“What kind of a sloop?”</p>

<p>I described the Catch Me as best I could.</p>

<p>“No such craft around this island,” said Carney,
after I had finished.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Certain. I was all around the shore only this
morning.”</p>

<p>I did not believe this statement, and I paused,
undecided what to do next.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>“Was it your sloop?” went on the fisherman.</p>

<p>“Yes. She was given to me the day she was
blown over.”</p>

<p>“That so? Why didn’t you see to her at once?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t have time. I was told she was somewhere
up here.”</p>

<p>“Who told you?”</p>

<p>“Tom Darrow.”</p>

<p>The instant I uttered the name I was sorry I had
done so for I did not wish to get my honest old
friend into trouble. The man I addressed scowled.</p>

<p>“Darrow ought to keep his mouth shut,” he muttered.
“The sloop ain’t here.”</p>

<p>“What boat is that over yonder?”</p>

<p>“That’s my own craft.”</p>

<p>“You have got her pretty well up the cove,” I
added.</p>

<p>The man scowled even deeper than before.</p>

<p>“See here, what business is that of yours?” he
demanded. “Reckon I can take my boat where I
please.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you can; I only asked. I reckon I
can do that.”</p>

<p>“I drew the boat up because I’m busy painting
her, and this is a good spot to do it.”</p>

<p>“Do you live here?” I went on, more to gain
time to think than for any desire to know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>“Sometimes. I’ve got a sort of a house here,
and another over to the shore yonder. I own this
island.”</p>

<p>This last assertion I knew to be a falsehood. I
had on my good clothes out of respect to my father’s
memory, and he evidently took me for one of the
summer boarders.</p>

<p>“I should like to see your boat,” I ventured.</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Just to see how a boat is painted. I may want
to do such a job myself some day.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m sorry, but you can’t see her,” replied
Carney decidedly.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t want anybody fooling around.
I’ve been mighty particular over the work, and I
don’t want it spoilt.”</p>

<p>“I won’t touch a thing.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know all about that! I ain’t going to
have no finger-marks all over the gun’ale and the
gold lines.”</p>

<p>I turned and looked at the mast, which was all I
could now see of the hidden craft. If my memory
served me rightly it was the exact counterpart of
the one belonging to the Catch Me. The man was
plainly lying, and had my property in his possession.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m coming ashore, anyway,” I returned;
and I jumped from the sloop to the rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean by disobeying my orders?”
cried Carney, rushing over to where I had landed.</p>

<p>“Disobeying your orders?” I repeated.</p>

<p>“Yes. You know well enough I don’t want you
to land here.”</p>

<p>“If I want to land I don’t see how you are going
to stop me,” I replied as coolly as I could, although
I was anxious as to the outcome of the situation.</p>

<p>“You don’t, eh? Didn’t I tell you I owned this
island?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it. The property has always been
in the families of several Bend Center folks.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about Bend Center?”</p>

<p>“I know all about it.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say you live there?” and
there was actual wonder in the man’s tone.</p>

<p>“I live near the place. I run the mill over at
Torrent Bend River.”</p>

<p>Carney stepped back.</p>

<p>“Are you Reuben Stone?” he cried.</p>

<p>“That’s my name.”</p>

<p>In spite of his bronzed face I saw the fellow turn
pale. What impression had the discovery of my
identity made upon him?</p>

<p>“I thought you said you owned the boat you are
looking for?” he said at length.</p>

<p>“So I do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>“The Catch Me belonged to Bayport.”</p>

<p>“I thought you didn’t know anything about her?”
I returned sharply.</p>

<p>“Well, I—I thought I didn’t,” he stammered;
“but what you said put me in mind of her.”</p>

<p>“She was given to me for rescuing the two men
and the woman and the boy who were sailing in
her.”</p>

<p>“Given to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Humph!” Carney tossed his head. “Well, she
ain’t here, and you had better look elsewhere for
her.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to take a walk around the island.”</p>

<p>I had hardly uttered the words before the man
caught me by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“You are going to do nothing of the sort!” he
cried. “I want you to clear out at once.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I don’t choose to do so?”</p>

<p>“I’ll make you.”</p>

<p>I looked at the fellow. He was pretty big, and
he looked strong; still I stood my ground.</p>

<p>“How are you going to make me go?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Do you see this gun? Well, if you don’t hustle
off you may feel it.”</p>

<p>In spite of my efforts to remain calm I shivered.
The weapon looked as if it was capable of doing
some wicked work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>“You see I’m the boss around Rock Island,”
went on Carney, “and I don’t take any talk from
any one. I want you to get out at once.”</p>

<p>And saying this, he stepped back and pointed the
gun at my head. I did not think he meant to fire
it. He thought he would scare me; that was all.
But it was not pleasant to have the barrel in line
with my head, and I stepped back and out of
range.</p>

<p>“Now get on board of your sloop, and pull up
anchor,” continued Carney. “I don’t want any more
talk.”</p>

<p>While he was speaking I watched my chance, and
as he lowered the gun I rushed forward, grasped it
with both hands, and pulled it away from him.</p>

<p>“Here! give me back that gun!” he exclaimed, as
I retreated.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it!” I returned. “You’ll find that
two can play at that game.”</p>

<p>And I brought up the barrel of the weapon on a
level with his breast.</p>

<p>“Don’t shoot!”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to if you behave yourself. Just
you march over to your right.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“Never mind; do as I tell you.”</p>

<p>With very bad grace Carney did as I had directed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
When he had reached a point fully fifteen yards
away I told him to halt. The spot was in the midst
of a number of barren rocks, and here I felt sure
that I could watch him.</p>

<p>“Now I am going to take a look at your boat,”
I went on. “Don’t you dare to move while I do
so.”</p>

<p>“Won’t do you any good,” he muttered.</p>

<p>Without replying, I made my way through the
rough brush and over the rocks to where the mast
of the boat could be seen. It was but a short distance,
and soon I stood face to face with the hidden
craft.</p>

<p>For an instant I did not recognize her. The blue-and-white
hull had given way to one of red, and the
name had been scratched and covered with several
coats of paint; but the general appearance of the
deck and rigging had not been changed, and I was
certain that the craft was the missing Catch Me.</p>

<p>Had I come a day later, the job of transformation
would have been complete, and the sloop might have
been lost to me forever. I counted myself lucky at
having made the trip of investigation as soon as I
had.</p>

<p>An instant later I looked around to see if Carney
was where I left him, and I was chagrined to note
that he had disappeared.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.<br>
<small>A BLOW FROM BEHIND.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>For an instant I did not know what to do. Carney
had vanished, and that, I was satisfied, boded no
good to me.</p>

<p>With my gun ready for use, I picked my way back
to the rock nearest to my boat, intending to embark
at once. The man was probably not alone on the
island, and had gone off for assistance. Perhaps he
would soon appear with the other two men Tom
Darrow had mentioned.</p>

<p>But as I jumped aboard my boat another surprise
awaited me. Carney was hidden under an old sail
forward, and I had hardly set foot upon deck when
he jumped up and struck me a cruel blow from
behind.</p>

<p>“Take that for interfering with me!” he cried.</p>

<p>I caught but a glimpse of him; then came the
blow, and I saw millions of stars. I staggered forward,
and for a while my senses forsook me.</p>

<p>I think I remained unconscious at least a quarter
of an hour. When I came to I found myself lying
on the bottom of my sloop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>Somewhat confused from the rough treatment I
had received, I raised my head and looked around
me. Water was on every hand, and I saw that the
craft had been shoved off from the island, and sent
drifting down the lake.</p>

<p>As soon as I was able I ran up the mainsail, and
then stood over for the west shore. There was no
use returning to Rock Island for the present.</p>

<p>Carney had his gun once more, and would not
now hesitate to use it. I must get some one to help
me before going back for my property.</p>

<p>I turned the matter over in my mind, and then
decided to return to the mill, leave the groceries and
Mr. Norton’s tobacco, and then sail down to the Bend
for Tom Darrow, and perhaps one or two others
with whom I was well acquainted, and who I knew
would help me.</p>

<p>As I skimmed over the surface of the lake I decided
not to tell Mr. Norton of what had happened
and of what I intended to do. It was none of his
affair, and he would no doubt claim the boat as part
of the estate under his charge. Perhaps I was not
doing right according to law, but I was no lawyer,
and I thought I could run matters quite as well as
he could.</p>

<p>The distance to the mill-landing was soon covered,
and then I lowered the sail and prepared to tie up.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
As I did so I saw two strange men walk out of the
mill-room, followed by my newly arrived relative.</p>

<p>I knew every man, woman, and child in the region,
and I was sure the two men were total strangers in
the lake district. They were short, small built, well
dressed; and I could not imagine what had brought
them to the place.</p>

<p>The spot where I had tied up was partly hidden
from the mill by a number of bushes and trees. I
saw that the painter was properly fastened, and then
walked slowly towards my home.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is no use of waiting any longer,” I
overheard one of the men say. “We have made
enough mistakes already. Delay will mean more.”</p>

<p>“Then you intend to go ahead to-night?” asked
the voice of Mr. Norton anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes. By the way, how do you get on with the
boy?”</p>

<p>“Pretty well. He’s rather high-strung. I expect
him back any moment. I sent him over to Bend
Center for some tobacco.”</p>

<p>“Good. Come, Bill; let’s be off before he returns.”</p>

<p>“Just as you say, Dick. You are running this
deal, not I.”</p>

<p>And with these words the two men passed out of
hearing, and made for the boat I had seen anchored
in the inlet when I had gone down to the Bend in
the morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span></p>

<p>This conversation surprised me not a little. At
first I had intended to come forward and show myself,
but now I was glad I had not done so.</p>

<p>Who were the two men? and what was their mission
to the mill? Plainly they were well known
to Mr. Norton; and yet he had just come from the
West, and had not been in Bend Center for many
years.</p>

<p>Perhaps these men were also from the West, and,
knowing Mr. Norton was at the mill, had stopped
over, most likely from Bayport, to see him. This
was a rather lame explanation, and it by no means
satisfied me. As to what was to be “gone ahead
with” that night I had not the faintest idea.</p>

<p>Ordinarily I would not have given the entire matter
any attention; but, as I have said, Mr. Norton’s
way of doing things did not suit me, and I was
anxious to find out something about him, and what
I was to expect from him in the future.</p>

<p>I waited for several minutes after the men had
gone, and then making rather more noise than was
necessary, walked up to the mill.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton met me at the door. “Back at last,
I see,” he said. “Got that tobacco?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir;” and I handed it over.</p>

<p>“Good. I’m nearly dead for a smoke. Do you
use the weed?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. Never start. It’s costly, and does
a fellow no good.”</p>

<p>I took the groceries I had brought, and put them
in the pantry. Mr. Norton filled his pipe, and
began to puff away vigorously.</p>

<p>“Always have to smoke when I’m thinking,” he remarked
as he blew a cloud of smoke to the ceiling.</p>

<p>I was on the point of asking him the subject of
his thoughts, but checked myself.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do now?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“If I can, I would like to get off for the rest of
the day,” I returned.</p>

<p>“Has that grinding got to be done?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; to-morrow will do.”</p>

<p>“Then you can go. I didn’t think about this
news of your father’s death being so new to you,
or I wouldn’t have asked you to go to work to-day.
Fact is, I’m all upset with traveling around. That’s
what riled my temper up last night.”</p>

<p>“I’m not used to such treatment,” I could not
help remarking.</p>

<p>“I suppose your father was very easy. Well,
we’ll let what’s gone alone, and take a new start.
What time do you expect to be back?”</p>

<p>“Some time this evening.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>“By the way,” I went on, as I walked towards
the door, “weren’t there two men here just before
I came?”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” he exclaimed in surprise.</p>

<p>I repeated my question.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see them,” he answered. “What made
you think they were here?”</p>

<p>His reply rather staggered me. I had not expected
so deliberate a falsehood.</p>

<p>“I thought I saw them,” I said simply.</p>

<p>“Must have been mistaken. Nobody here since you
went away.”</p>

<p>I walked down to the sloop in a thoughtful frame
of mind. What did this false statement mean?
Surely there was some mystery connected with the
visit of the two strangers,—a mystery that Mr.
Norton was anxious to conceal.</p>

<p>I was half inclined to turn back and find out what
was “in the wind;” but I concluded that for the
present it would be useless to do so. No one but my
uncle was about, and he would not tell me a word.</p>

<p>When I reached the pier at the Bend I found Tom
Darrow at his accustomed place, disposing of a big
mess of fish he had caught during the morning. I
told him of what had happened at the island, and
he agreed to go with me without delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<p>“Never mind taking anybody else,” he said. “I
know Andy Carney. He is a rough customer, but
a regular coward at heart. When he sees that we
mean business he’ll cave right in.”</p>

<p>“I trust it is as you say, Tom,” I replied. “He
was pretty ugly this noon.”</p>

<p>“We’ll manage him, never fear.”</p>

<p>“If we get the sloop, I wish you would take
charge of her for me,” I continued. “I don’t care
to take her down to the mill-landing.”</p>

<p>“I will, Rube.”</p>

<p>Tom jumped aboard, and we were off and up the
lake. It was now getting well on in the afternoon,
and by the time we approached the island the sun
was setting.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to be careful,” I said; “Carney may
be on the lookout for us.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t dare to fire at us,” laughed Darrow.</p>

<p>But I shook my head. Carney was a desperate
character, and I would have felt safer had I had a
gun on board, which, unfortunately, was not the case.</p>

<p>At length we rounded the south shore of Rock
Island, and stood up for the north end. As we did
so Darrow drew attention to another craft directly
ahead.</p>

<p>“There’s a boat I’ve seen a number of times in
the past few days,” he said. “If I ain’t mistaken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
it’s the same I saw towing that raft behind it—the
raft that I guess was the Catch Me on her side.”</p>

<p>I looked, and was sure I had seen the boat before.
Then we ran closer to her, and just as we passed
around a bend I caught sight of the boat’s side, and
recognized her as the same craft the two strangers had
used on their visit to the mill.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.<br>
<small>THE TWO STRANGERS.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The discovery I made was totally unexpected, and for
the moment I did not know what to make of it. Darrow
noticed my peculiar look, and asked what was up.</p>

<p>“That’s just what I would like to know, Tom,” I
replied. “Let us run in here out of sight. I want
to tell you something.”</p>

<p>I pointed to a cove close at hand, and the old
fisherman turned and we swept behind the bushes.</p>

<p>“You are sure that is the same boat you saw towing
the sloop?” I questioned eagerly.</p>

<p>“Guess I am. My eyes don’t deceive me very
often, though they are getting old.”</p>

<p>“Is the boat a strange one around the Bend?”</p>

<p>“Yes; but it belongs on the lake.”</p>

<p>“Is it Carney’s?”</p>

<p>“Maybe it is. But did you see it around the
island when you were here before?”</p>

<p>“No; it was over at the mill.”</p>

<p>And I told him what I knew of the boat and the
two men who had sailed her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>“Well, that’s strange,” he said. “Most likely the
two chaps are on board now.”</p>

<p>“If so, what are they doing here?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“That’s to be found out,” returned Darrow slowly.
“It’s more than likely they ain’t up to no good—with
all due respect to your uncle,” he added hastily.</p>

<p>“Never mind about that,” I said. “To tell you the
truth, I don’t like Mr. Norton one bit. He treated
me like a dog from the start, and there is something
in my breast that tells me that he does not
mean me well.”</p>

<p>And I told the old fisherman of all I had gone
through since the sad news of my father’s death had
been received.</p>

<p>He was deeply interested and highly indignant by
the time I had finished.</p>

<p>“Ford was right,” he burst out; “I wouldn’t mind
helping him to a ride on a rail myself. He ain’t fit
to be the guardian of a cow. You will have to watch
him, or he’ll spend the proceeds of your father’s estate
on himself. If I were you I’d make him prove that
he loaned all the money to your father that he says
he has.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking about that. I imagine all the
business ought to be brought before the court.”</p>

<p>“So it had. If I was you I’d go over to Squire
Slocum’s house some time, and state the case.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>“So I will.” I paused for a moment. “But we
are off the track for the present. We must go ahead,
and see if these two men are in league with Carney.”</p>

<p>“They must be,” said Darrow, as we allowed my
sloop to forge ahead again. “If not, how could they
have his boat?”</p>

<p>“They might have hired it, and left him waiting
for them on the island,” I suggested.</p>

<p>But I did not believe such to be a fact, and Darrow
agreed with me. The three were evidently banded
together, and for no good purpose.</p>

<p>At length the sloop ahead disappeared up the mouth
of a long inlet. Seeing this, we allowed my craft to
come up to the bank some distance behind, and here
I tied fast, and we went ashore.</p>

<p>“Now let us be careful,” I whispered. “I want
to see what the three are up to without being seen.”</p>

<p>“All right; I’ll be as careful as a cat,” responded
Darrow.</p>

<p>We picked our way around the rocks and through
the bushes silently. Presently the murmur of voices
broke upon my sharpened ears, and I knew we were
drawing close to our objective point. I placed my
hand on the fisherman’s shoulder as a signal for him
to halt, and listened with all attention.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Carney!” some one suddenly called.</p>

<p>There was no answer, and the cry was repeated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span></p>

<p>“Hullo! Is that you, friends?” came back the reply.</p>

<p>“Yes. Where are you?”</p>

<p>“This way.” There was a moment’s pause, and
then the party of three were joined. “You’ve been
pretty long, strangers,” went on Carney.</p>

<p>“We had to fix a number of things,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Did you get everything straight?”</p>

<p>“Pretty much so,” replied the fellow who had been
addressed as Dick.</p>

<p>“Good for you, Mr. Avery!”</p>

<p>I was intensely interested in this bit of conversation.
It proved beyond a doubt that Mr. Norton and
the two strangers were in league together and that
Carney was in the circle. The four were up to no
good; but what their plans were for the future was
not yet made plain.</p>

<p>“How are you getting on with your boat?” went
on Yates the third man.</p>

<p>“Slowly.” Carney paused for a moment. “I’ve
had a visitor since you’ve been gone.”</p>

<p>Both men were surprised.</p>

<p>“Who?” both asked in a breath.</p>

<p>“Reuben Stone.”</p>

<p>Yates and Avery uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean it!” cried the latter.</p>

<p>“It’s so.”</p>

<p>“What did he want?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span></p>

<p>“Wanted the boat. He said it belonged to him.
He rescued the people who were on board, and they
gave him the craft for the service.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the oddest thing I ever came across!”
ejaculated Yates. “Norton didn’t say anything about
the boy coming over here. What did you do?”</p>

<p>“Sent the boy about his business. Told him the
boat wasn’t anywhere near the island.”</p>

<p>It will readily be seen from the above that Andy
Carney knew how to draw upon his imagination. I
could not help but smile at his version of our meeting.</p>

<p>“You are sure the boy knows nothing about the
boat being here?”</p>

<p>“Positive.”</p>

<p>“Because we don’t want him to be nosing about
here later on.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fear about that. I’m going to take her
away as soon as I can. Do you men want to get
over to Bayport now?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Yates. “Land us about half a
mile above the town.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>The three men moved off towards the place where
the sloop had been left. They passed close to where
Darrow and I were in hiding. For an instant I
thought we would be discovered, but then they disappeared
around the rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p>“We will follow them,” I whispered.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want to stay behind and get the boat?”
asked Darrow.</p>

<p>“Yes; but I want to see them off first.”</p>

<p>So silently as shadows we followed the trio to the
shore, and saw them enter Carney’s boat.</p>

<p>In doing this they ran within half a dozen yards
of where my own craft was tied up. For an instant
my heart stood in my throat. Would they see her?
If so, what would be the consequence?</p>

<p>But the three did not notice the craft, and soon
they were a goodly distance from the shore. With
a sigh of relief I rose from my cramped position, and
told Darrow to follow me.</p>

<p>In a moment we were within sight of the Catch
Me. Since I had been gone Carney had been working
like a beaver changing her appearance. He had
shortened her mast and spars, put a different kind
of a top to the cabin, and finished the painting.</p>

<p>“In a day more, no one would be able to recognize
her,” I said. “I suppose he thought he would
be safe after he had finished his work.”</p>

<p>“It’s a big swindle!” cried Darrow. “But you’ll
cut him off short. No doubt he intends to come
back for her as soon as he has landed those two
men, who, to my guessing, are no good.”</p>

<p>“That’s just my idea. Well, we’ll get the best<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
of him this time. New paint or not, I must get the
boat out of this inlet, and tow her over to the Torrent
Bend shore.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk. Come, we’ll get to work without
delay.”</p>

<p>“But you may get all paint, Tom,” I protested.</p>

<p>“I won’t mind that; I’ve got on my old clothes.
Come ahead. Won’t Carney be surprised when he
finds the boat gone!”</p>

<p>“He might have expected that I would be back.”</p>

<p>“But he didn’t expect you quite so soon. Of
course he run a risk, but now he thinks it is all right.
No doubt he will keep an eye on all boats steering for
the island while he is making the run to Bayport.”</p>

<p>We were soon at work on the Catch Me. I got
out the anchor rope, and by hard tugging we managed
to slide the craft off the rocks upon which she
was partly resting.</p>

<p>Then by taking off our shoes and stockings, and
wading in the shallow water, we dragged her out of
the inlet, and anchored her some distance from shore.</p>

<p>After this I made my way across the island to
where I had left my small craft. I soon had her
untied and over to the spot where I wanted her.
Darrow then came on board, and we fastened the
painter to the bow of the Catch Me, and started for
the shore above the mill.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t want to take her where Mr. Norton can
see her,” I explained. “I want to keep her out of
sight until I’ve seen Squire Slocum, and got his advice
about my father’s estate. Even if the man is
my uncle I don’t like him, and his actions seem very
suspicious.”</p>

<p>It did not take us long to cover the distance from
Rock Island to the shore. Here I knew of a pretty
little cove, well hidden by bushes, that was rarely
visited. I ran into it, and there secured the Catch
Me, intending to let her remain there until matters
were more settled all around.</p>

<p>“Now if you are done with me I’ll leave you right
here,” said Darrow as I was about to go back to my
small boat. “I want to go up the main road a bit, and
see Gus Hallett.”</p>

<p>A moment later I was left alone. I hoisted sail, and
was soon standing down to the mill landing. As I
approached, another boat rounded the bend. I saw
that it contained two strangers, and Ben Pointer the
Bend Center constable.</p>

<p>“There is Stone now,” I heard Pointer say.</p>

<p>“Is it? Then arrest him on the spot,” returned one
of the strangers. “I am sure he is the thief.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.<br>
<small>A SURPRISE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I was never so astonished in my life as when I
heard one of the new-comers in the boat order the
constable to arrest me at once. I had done no wrong,
and I could not make the matter out.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Stone!” sang out Constable Pointer.
“Hold up; we want to see you.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to tie up at the landing,” I replied;
and as I spoke I lowered the sail.</p>

<p>The two men in the other boat did the same, and
soon all hands were standing on the little wharf.</p>

<p>“What do you want of me, Pointer?” I inquired,
looking from one to the other of the three men.</p>

<p>“He’s going to arrest you, young man,” replied
the elder of the two others.</p>

<p>“Arrest me! What for?”</p>

<p>“You know well enough.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least idea,” I returned. “I haven’t
done anything wrong.”</p>

<p>“Too thin! Do you know who I am?”</p>

<p>“I do not.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span></p>

<p>“My name is Williams—Richard Williams, and
I’m the owner of the Catch Me, the craft you have
stolen.”</p>

<p>I was rather surprised at this speech, but relieved
to think that I was not accused of some other
crime.</p>

<p>“I did not steal your boat, Mr. Williams,” I replied
as calmly as I could.</p>

<p>“I have pretty plain evidence that you did,” returned
the boat-owner warmly.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, you are mistaken, and you ought
to know it.”</p>

<p>“I ought to know it? Young man, what do you
mean?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t Mr. Markham pay you for the boat?”</p>

<p>“Pay me! Not a cent, sir; not a cent!”</p>

<p>I was surprised.</p>

<p>“He didn’t pay you?” I gasped.</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t; and besides, even if he did, the
boat is still mine. When a man hires a boat for a
day he isn’t supposed to keep her forever.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say he didn’t even pay you for
hiring her?” I asked faintly.</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t; and you know it. He was the
biggest rogue at the hotel, and when he left he owed
me nearly fifty dollars for boat-hire.”</p>

<p>The news actually staggered me. Mr. Markham a
fraud! I could not believe it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span></p>

<p>“Well, he told me he would pay you for the boat,
and then she should be mine,” I explained. “I saved
him and his family from drowning when the boat
went over. He even wanted me to take a reward besides,
and took me to the bank to get the money.”</p>

<p>“And did he get the money?” questioned Mr.
Williams.</p>

<p>“No; he had some difficulty, and”—</p>

<p>“Rather guess he did have some difficulty,” sneered
the boat-owner.</p>

<p>“That man was nothing more nor less than a
swindler,” put in the constable. “He tried his best
to do the bank out of several thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“I can hardly believe it,” I replied. “He looked
every inch a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Where is the boat?” demanded Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>“She is just in the cove above, sir. I suppose,
then, she doesn’t belong to me,” I added, with a
sinking heart.</p>

<p>“Hardly, young man; unless you want to pay four
hundred dollars for her.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t pay four hundred cents.”</p>

<p>Considerably downcast, I led the way to where
the Catch Me rode at anchor.</p>

<p>All my high hopes concerning her and what I
might realize by a sale melted away.</p>

<p>“Then you didn’t take her on purpose?” asked
Pointer, as we walked along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>“Certainly not,” I replied. “I thought she was
my property.”</p>

<p>“It’s quite likely men are giving away such valuable
presents,” sneered the man who had not yet
spoken.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, he appeared wealthy enough to do
so, and he said I could have her,” I cried hotly.
“I wouldn’t steal a pin!”</p>

<p>There was no reply to this, and presently we came
in sight of the Catch Me.</p>

<p>“That my boat?” ejaculated Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>“That’s the Catch Me,” I replied. “Some men
tried to steal her and alter her appearance.”</p>

<p>“A likely story! This is some of your own
work”—</p>

<p>“It is not!”</p>

<p>“And I say it is. I believe you are in with this
Markham,” stormed Mr. Williams. “You towed the
boat in here, and expected to fix her up in such a
fashion that no one would know her again. Pointer,
I want him arrested.”</p>

<p>I started back. The word arrest sent a chill
through my body.</p>

<p>“Believe me or not, Mr. Williams, I am innocent,”
I cried. “Mr. Markham gave me this boat—at least
he said I could have her. I went on a hunt for her,
and took Tom Darrow the fisherman with me. I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
found that a fellow named Andy Carney had taken
her to Rock Island, and was at work on her. We
waited till Carney and his chums, two in number,
had left the island, and then we hooked fast and
dragged her over here. That’s the whole story, and
it’s the truth.”</p>

<p>And I looked the boat-owner squarely in the eye as
I spoke.</p>

<p>My manner had an effect upon him. He bit his
lip.</p>

<p>“You say Darrow helped you find the boat?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. If you don’t believe it, ask him.
Every one in the Bend knows Tom wouldn’t lie
about it.”</p>

<p>“And you say a fellow named Carney took the
boat in the first place?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. He had two strangers with him.”</p>

<p>“Then if your story is true I will have Pointer
arrest that man. This mutilation of my property
is shameful. But you must come along and prove
your story.”</p>

<p>“Tom Darrow isn’t at the Bend now. He left to
call on Gus Hallett, who lives about half a mile up
the main road.”</p>

<p>“Is he there now?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span></p>

<p>“We’ll go up and see him at once,” said Mr.
Williams.</p>

<p>Leaving the other man in charge of the Catch
Me, with instructions to sail her over to Bayport,
the boat-owner told the constable and me to lead
the way.</p>

<p>We met Darrow just coming away from the Hallett
cottage. He was surprised to see me, and more
surprised when I informed him of the object of our
coming.</p>

<p>“What! Rube steal that boat!” he exclaimed.
“Why, Mr. Williams, it’s plain to see you don’t
know much about the Bend! The Stones are every
one of them as honest as a summer day is long.”</p>

<p>And then he told what he knew of the affair.</p>

<p>His statement corroborated mine so well that the
boat-owner was forced to believe that I had told
him the truth; but he was still indignant regarding
the treatment the Catch Me had received, and he
made us promise to appear against Carney whenever
wanted.</p>

<p>We then walked back to the mill-landing. As we
did so, Mr. Norton came out of the mill, and approached
with a questioning look on his face.</p>

<p>“What’s up?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing much,” I replied briefly.</p>

<p>“There seems to be,” he went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>“Who are you?” asked Mr. Williams.</p>

<p>“I am Enos Norton, this boy’s uncle and guardian.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed! Well, you can be thankful. We
came very near arresting the boy.”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton was greatly taken aback. He asked
half a dozen questions at once, and he grew pale at
the mention of Carney’s name.</p>

<p>“Have—have you arrested that man?” he faltered.</p>

<p>“No; but we’re going to,” replied Constable
Pointer.</p>

<p>“Of course, of course,” said Mr. Norton uneasily.
“He has done a great wrong. Reuben, you should
have told me that Mr. Markham gave you the
sloop.”</p>

<p>To this I made no reply. A little later Mr. Williams
and Pointer went on board their boat, and
Darrow accompanied them. They were bound for
Bayport, and expected to catch Andy Carney on his
return to Rock Island.</p>

<p>I walked to the mill slowly, Mr. Norton following.
I was deeply perplexed. What did Mr. Markham
mean by his course of action? Had he really intended
to dupe me, or was there some mistake?</p>

<p>Mr. Norton watched me closely, but said no more
until we were inside of the mill; then he slammed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
the door shut and faced me, his face growing dark
with passion.</p>

<p>“Reuben!” he cried, savagely.</p>

<p>“Well, sir?” I returned.</p>

<p>“I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by trying to play an under
hand game on me?” he demanded.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.<br>
<small>MR. NORTON’S MOVE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was plain to see that Mr. Norton was deeply
angered; indeed, he seemed to be in as violent a
rage as it is possible for a man to attain. His teeth
were tightly closed, and his hands twitched nervously.</p>

<p>I made no reply to his last words, and then he
went on,—</p>

<p>“Don’t you understand that I am your guardian,
and that I am to be informed of all your affairs?”</p>

<p>“I understand that you are to know all about the
mill matters,” I said evasively.</p>

<p>“And about your matters too. Why didn’t you
tell me about the boat, and your going after her?”</p>

<p>“Because I didn’t choose to do so, sir.”</p>

<p>I did not like his manner of speech, and I spoke
defiantly. Had he been more reasonable in his actions
I should have answered him as respectfully as
was possible.</p>

<p>“You didn’t choose to do so?” he repeated.</p>

<p>“No, sir. It was my own private affair, and had
nothing to do with my father’s estate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span></p>

<p>“Humph! don’t you know that you are a minor?”</p>

<p>“I do know that.”</p>

<p>“And that you have nothing but what is included
in your father’s estate, and subject to the claims I
have against it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what the law is on that point. I
shall find out very soon.”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton changed color.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?” he asked in a low
voice.</p>

<p>“I mean that I am going to see the proper authorities,
and have the case go on in the proper way.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you are going to see
some lawyer?”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>

<p>“You young fool, you! What good will that do?”
he retorted.</p>

<p>“It may do a good deal of good. I don’t know
anything about the law, and I want matters straight.”</p>

<p>“You’ll incur a lot of unnecessary expense; that’s
all. We can settle this matter just as well between
ourselves. I have bills for all that is due me, and
after these are paid the balance shall be held in trust
for you.”</p>

<p>I made no reply. Had Mr. Norton been a different
kind of a man I might have been satisfied with his
plan, but I could not bring myself to trust him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span></p>

<p>“Did you hear what I said?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I did, sir.”</p>

<p>“And agree to it?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; I am going to see Squire Slocum about
the matter.”</p>

<p>“You will gain nothing by it.”</p>

<p>“I shall be better satisfied.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you don’t trust me?”</p>

<p>To this I made no reply.</p>

<p>“Answer me!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to have the thing settled by law, sir.”</p>

<p>“And how soon?” he sneered.</p>

<p>“As soon as possible. I’ll go and see Squire Slocum
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>I had hardly uttered the words when Mr. Norton
grasped me by the collar and jammed me up against
the wall.</p>

<p>“You’ll do nothing of the kind!” he foamed. “I
won’t have the money squandered in court!”</p>

<p>“Let go of me!” I cried.</p>

<p>“No, I won’t; until you promise to behave and do
as I say!”</p>

<p>“I—I—won’t promise.”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton’s grasp was a tight one, and I was in
danger of choking. I tried to break away, but he
held me fast.</p>

<p>“You will promise!” he stormed. “I am not to
be tricked by a boy!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span></p>

<p>For reply I kicked out with my right boot as hard
as I could. The blow caught the man in the shin,
and howling with pain he relaxed his grip, and I
squirmed away and made for the door.</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!”</p>

<p>“I won’t stop,” I returned, when I was at a safe
distance. “I am not to be treated like a dog.”</p>

<p>“Come here, Reuben! I’m not going to treat you
like a dog. I only want you to act reasonably.”</p>

<p>“I am acting reasonably.”</p>

<p>“No, you’re not. Come in here and get supper
ready. It’s time we had it—going on eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>What was I to do? I was tremendously hungry,
and to a growing boy his appetite is an important
thing. I lingered on the doorstep.</p>

<p>“Come in here and prepare supper,” he repeated.</p>

<p>“Will you promise not to touch me if I do?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll promise,” he replied somewhat doggedly.</p>

<p>For an instant more I hesitated, and then I re-entered
the living-room of the mill. Mr. Norton did
not offer to lay hands on me, and I set to work
getting the evening meal on the table.</p>

<p>“Do you know this Carney?” he asked after a
long spell of silence.</p>

<p>“I know of him,” I replied briefly.</p>

<p>“Who were the other two men?” he went on,
pulling out his pipe and filling it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>“Strangers around here,” I said, but did not add
that they were the two that had called on him during
my absence.</p>

<p>“Were they with this Carney when he went away?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton got up and took several turns about
the room.</p>

<p>“Got that supper ready?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“Almost.”</p>

<p>“Well, hurry up! I want to go down to Bend
Center this evening.”</p>

<p>“This evening!” I exclaimed. “It’s rather late.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t the tavern open?”</p>

<p>“I suppose it is.”</p>

<p>There was another period of silence, and we sat
down to eat. I wondered what had put Mr. Norton
in the notion of going to the Bend that night. Was
he really going to the tavern, or was he going to
head me off by seeing Squire Slocum before I had
the chance of doing so?</p>

<p>It did not take him five minutes to finish, and
then he arose and put on his hat.</p>

<p>“Do you know the way?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” he snarled. “Didn’t I live here
years ago?”</p>

<p>That was true; and this put the thought into my
mind that perhaps he was going to call on some old
acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span></p>

<p>But then I remembered that one of the two strangers
had said that something was to be done that
night. Did Mr. Norton propose to take a hand in this?</p>

<p>“When will you be back?”</p>

<p>“In an hour or so. You had better go to bed.
I suppose you are tired.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>In a moment more Mr. Norton was gone, and I
was left alone. I cleared away the dishes, and then
sat down in the big rocker to think matters over.</p>

<p>I was confused over the things that had happened
since Mr. Norton’s arrival. His claims and the affair
of the Catch Me bewildered me. I was but a boy,
brought up almost in the backwoods, and I could
not reason out what was going on.</p>

<p>But I was satisfied that something was wrong. It
seemed to be in the very air, and I could not help
but feel it.</p>

<p>Then my mind reverted to my father’s untimely
end, and I shed bitter tears as I thought over how
I had been thus suddenly left alone in the world.</p>

<p>My meditations were interrupted by a heavy knock
on the door. I sprang to my feet, wondering who
the visitor could be.</p>

<p>An instant later the knock was repeated, even
louder than before. I bade the person enter. The
door swung open, and I found myself face to face
with Andy Carney!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span></p>

<p>I was startled, and stepped back. The fisherman
saw that I was alone, and he shut the door behind
him and locked it.</p>

<p>“Carney!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s me,” he replied. “Guess, young fellow,
you didn’t just expect to have me call on you.” And
he leered at me wickedly.</p>

<p>I began to feel uneasy at once. There was nothing
at hand by which I could defend myself.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” I asked, as coolly as I could.</p>

<p>“I come over to get even with you. What do
you mean by setting Rich Williams on my track?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Williams was after his boat.”</p>

<p>“Thought you said it was your boat?”</p>

<p>“I thought it was; but the man who gave it to
me didn’t pay for it, and so I had to give it up. Did
you see Mr. Williams?”</p>

<p>“Did I see him?” The fellow uttered a short
laugh. “Yes, I seen him; and it was all I could do
to get away. But I want you to understand that
you have got to shoulder this scrape. I’ve got nothing
to do with it.”</p>

<p>“You altered the boat,” I returned; “and you
tried to steal her too.”</p>

<p>“Stop right there!” he cried. “Do you see this?
I mean business.” And as he spoke he drew out a
pistol.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.<br>
<small>A MIDNIGHT CRIME.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I saw the pistol, and I was properly alarmed. It
is said that there are those who can look in the barrel
of such a weapon unflinchingly. If so, I am not
one of the kind.</p>

<p>I did my best to get out of range; and seeing this,
Carney laughed again.</p>

<p>“Scared you, did I?” he said.</p>

<p>“I don’t care to have a pistol pointed at me.”</p>

<p>“No, I suppose not, nor a gun either,” with another
laugh.</p>

<p>“What do you want here?”</p>

<p>“I told you I’d come to get square with you.”</p>

<p>“What do you intend to do?”</p>

<p>“Anybody here with you?”</p>

<p>“None of your business!”</p>

<p>“Hold up there!”</p>

<p>And again the weapon was pointed at my head.</p>

<p>“This is my house, and I want you to leave it,” I
returned as steadily as I could.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave it when I please. Hullo there!” he
shouted at the top of his voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span></p>

<p>I expected to see some one enter in response to
his call, but I was mistaken.</p>

<p>“Guess you are alone,” he went on after a pause.
“Now tell me, how much money have you got in
the house?”</p>

<p>I was startled at this question. Undoubtedly the
man meant to rob me.</p>

<p>“Haven’t a dollar.”</p>

<p>“Come, now, no lying.”</p>

<p>“I have told you the truth.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall take a look around myself.”</p>

<p>“Did you come here to steal?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“None of your business! Sit down in that chair,
and don’t you dare to move until I tell you.”</p>

<p>And Carney emphasized his words with a shake of
the pistol.</p>

<p>I sat down in the chair as directed, and the fisherman
began a rapid search of the apartment. It was
not long before he came across the hand-satchel Mr.
Norton had carried when he arrived.</p>

<p>“Locked, eh?” he said, as he examined it. “Where
is the key?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t it! It belongs to my uncle.”</p>

<p>“Your uncle! Where is he?”</p>

<p>“Just stepped out.”</p>

<p>“Glad you told me. I’ll get through before he
returns.” Carney stepped to the mantel-shelf and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
took off a number of small things of value. “You
are sure about that money?”</p>

<p>“I know I haven’t a dollar,” I returned.</p>

<p>“Turn out your pockets.”</p>

<p>“I’ll see you in Halifax first!” I burst out. “You
sha’n’t go a step farther in your doings, not if I
have to die for it!”</p>

<p>And watching my chance, I sprang at the man, and
pushed his pistol aside.</p>

<p>He was surprised at my temerity, and for a moment
I had the best of the battle; but then he gathered
himself together, and sent me sprawling on the floor.</p>

<p>“Now lay there, and don’t you dare to move!” he
commanded. “I don’t want to be too ugly, but I
will be if you don’t mind what I say.”</p>

<p>Then leaving me half dazed, he went hurriedly
through the other rooms, gathering quite a number
of things, some of which he stuffed in his pockets,
and others in an old valise he found in the mill-room.</p>

<p>“Now I guess I’m square,” he said, when he had
finished. “Don’t you dare to follow me or give me
away, Stone, or it will be the worse for you. I ain’t
a man to be trifled with, and don’t you forget it.”</p>

<p>Then he passed out of the door and was gone.</p>

<p>Oh, how I wished that I had a pistol at that moment!
I am not a bloodthirsty fellow, but it galled
me to see this ruffian walk off with my property.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span></p>

<p>But the only weapon in the mill was an old gun,
and this was unloaded, and had not been fired for
several months; in fact, not since the winter, when
I had gone rabbit-hunting.</p>

<p>No sooner had the fellow departed, however, than
I made up my mind to find out where he was going
to, and, if possible, to recover what he had taken.</p>

<p>I got down the old gun, and hastily cleaning out
the barrel, loaded it up; then putting on my hat I
stole out of the mill, and in the direction that Carney
had taken.</p>

<p>There was no moon, but the stars were shining
brightly, and it was far from being absolutely dark.</p>

<p>Carney had gone off in the direction of the main
road, and soon I caught sight of him some distance
ahead. I made as little noise as possible as I drew
nearer to him.</p>

<p>The man walked rapidly until he passed Hallett’s
house; then he made for the lake, and I rightfully
conjectured that he was going to his boat, which he
had left some distance up the shore.</p>

<p>As he approached the water, I drew nearer to him.
He passed down a bed of rocks, and there hidden in
the bushes was his craft.</p>

<p>Just as he prepared to cast off I hailed him. He
was startled, and turned as if to pull out his pistol.</p>

<p>“Stop that!” I ordered. “I have a gun now, and
I can fire as straight as you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>“So you’ve followed me,” he sneered.</p>

<p>“I have. Just you hand over that stuff.”</p>

<p>“Not much! I took some trouble to get it, and
I mean to keep it. It isn’t much; but every little
counts.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you just one minute to hand it over,”
I went on; and I pointed the gun at his head.</p>

<p>Suddenly he jumped behind the mast, and shoved
the boat from the shore. I fired one shot in the air,
to scare him,—for it was not in my heart to shoot
any one,—and then plunged into the shallow water
after him.</p>

<p>But he was beyond me, and the next instant he
had his sail up, and was leaving the shore rapidly.
He kept well out of range, so I could not have hit
him even if I had wanted to do so.</p>

<p>“You’re not smart enough for me!” he called back
tauntingly. And in a moment he passed out of sight
in the gloom.</p>

<p>I stood still for a while, not knowing what to do
next. Following the fellow had been of no avail.
He had got away and taken with him all the valuable
stuff that was lying around the mill.</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but to return home and
make the best of the matter. And this I did, pausing
in front of the Hallett homestead and wondering if
it would do any good to awaken old Mr. Hallett
and ask him for his assistance in going after Carney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span></p>

<p>But this I decided not to do, for the old man was
very fussy, and we were not exactly on the best of
terms.</p>

<p>When I reached the mill all was quiet and just
as I had left it, less than an hour before. I looked at
the old clock that stood in one corner of the living-room
and was astonished to find that it was already
past midnight.</p>

<p>I sat down in the rocker with my brain busy thinking.
But as moment after moment passed, my head
sank back and my eyelids gradually closed. Everything
was quiet save the loud tick, tick, of the old
clock, and this soon put me into a sound sleep.</p>

<p>Once or twice I came very near waking up. Then
I thought I was aroused by the flash of a bright light
and a peculiar sensation in my nose and throat. But
I immediately sank back, and went into a deeper
sleep than ever.</p>

<p>When I awoke it was sunrise, and the light was
streaming into the window and across the floor. I
jumped to my feet; and as I did so, a small stone of
peculiar brilliancy, lying on the floor, attracted my
attention.</p>

<p>I picked the stone up and examined it. If it was
not a diamond, it was a fine imitation, I wondered
from whence it had come.</p>

<p>I could remember of no one about the mill having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
a diamond. To my knowledge Mr. Norton did not
wear any such expensive ornament. The only man
I knew of in the vicinity who sported such a stone
was Mr. Jackson, the storekeeper, and on his visit
to the mill he had not been near the living-room.</p>

<p>I gave the stone a second examination. As I did
so I heard a footstep outside and slipped the thing
into my pocket.</p>

<p>The next moment Mr. Norton came into the room
from the sleeping apartment beyond. His face was
pale and I wondered when he had come in, and if
he had slept much.</p>

<p>“Woke up, have you?” he exclaimed. “’Tain’t
a very nice place to go to sleep in.”</p>

<p>“I found the chair very comfortable,” I returned,
trying to determine what would be best to say in
regard to the robbery.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you go to bed?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t get a chance. I—”</p>

<p>“Never mind with your excuses. Have you got
breakfast ready?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; but I soon will have.”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton took a pull from the flask he always
kept in his pocket, and then got out his pipe and fell
to smoking.</p>

<p>I set the table in silence and started to make the
coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<p>I noticed he was very uneasy, and looked at me
half a dozen times rather curiously.</p>

<p>Presently his eye wandered over to where his valise
had stood and he noticed that the bag was missing.</p>

<p>“What have you done with my grip?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It was stolen last night,” I said, as steadily as
I could.</p>

<p>“Stolen!”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“You can’t mean it!” he ejaculated, facing me
with a look of horror on his face.</p>

<p>“It was stolen, and so were a lot of other things.”</p>

<p>“Boy, you lie!”</p>

<p>“It’s the truth.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe a word of it!” gasped Mr. Norton,
catching his breath.</p>

<p>I could see that he was fearfully agitated, and wondered
what the valise could have contained.</p>

<p>“I tell the truth. It was stolen along with a lot
of other things that belonged to the mill. Andy—”</p>

<p>“You can’t fool me!” shouted Mr. Norton. “You
have taken those things away yourself. I thought
from the start that you might be deeper than you
appeared, and now I’m sure of it. I was a fool to
be taken in. Tell me this instant everything you
have found out!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.<br>
<small>AT SQUIRE SLOCUM’S HOUSE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was evident that Mr. Enos Norton was terribly
in earnest. Compared with his present state, his former
anger appeared as child’s play.</p>

<p>“I have told you the exact truth,” I replied.
“Andy Carney came in here last night and stole the
things.”</p>

<p>“Andy Carney! The man you say stole the
boat?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton was silent for a moment.</p>

<p>“Reuben, I don’t believe your story,” he cried at
length. “You’ve taken that valise yourself, and put
away the other things to make your story appear
plausible. Now, I want you to tell me exactly all you
have discovered, otherwise it will go hard with you.”</p>

<p>I remained silent. What more was there to say?</p>

<p>“Did you hear me?” stormed my guardian.</p>

<p>“I hear you,” I replied as calmly as I could, which
is not saying much.</p>

<p>“Well, why don’t you answer then?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>“I have told the truth.”</p>

<p>I had hardly uttered the words before Mr. Norton
sprang at me.</p>

<p>“You will find I am not to be trifled with!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“And you will find out that I am not to be treated
like a dog,” I returned. And I ran across the
room and towards the door leading to the store-room.</p>

<p>“No, you don’t! You sha’n’t escape me like this!”
he shouted. And he ran after me and placed himself
directly in front of the door.</p>

<p>For an instant I was dismayed. Then I thought
of the window close at hand, and throwing it open,
sprang out.</p>

<p>“Stop! stop!” he cried as he darted towards the
opening.</p>

<p>Instead of heeding his command, I made the best
possible use of my time in putting a good distance
between us. I had got at least three rods away from
the house when he appeared at the door and started
after me.</p>

<p>“I tell you to stop, Reuben!” he called for at
least the tenth time.</p>

<p>“I’m going to the village,” I yelled back.</p>

<p>“If you don’t come back it will be the worse for
you!”</p>

<p>“I’ll chance it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span></p>

<p>A look down towards the boat-landing proved that
my boat was not there, and I hurried along the main
road. I did not stop running until I was fully a
quarter of a mile from the mill, and then it was only
to drop into a quick walk.</p>

<p>As I hurried along I thought over my situation,
and made up my mind that the best thing I could do
was to call on Squire Slocum and state my case.
The squire had been a warm friend of my father,
and I felt certain that he would give me some sound
advice, and tell me how to proceed.</p>

<p>I reached Bend Center long before seven o’clock.
I was not certain whether I would find Squire Slocum
up, so I walked around to the back of the house
to ask the hired girl when I could best see him.</p>

<p>“The squire went over to Bayport an hour ago,”
she said.</p>

<p>“To Bayport?” I repeated. “It’s pretty early in
the morning.”</p>

<p>“There’s some trouble at the bank there,” replied
the girl. “A messenger came over and woke us all
up. He wanted the squire right away, and he had
to go off without waiting to get his breakfast.”</p>

<p>My curiosity was aroused at once.</p>

<p>“What was the trouble at the bank?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“And you don’t know when the squire will return?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span></p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>I walked away slowly, my head filled with all
sorts of thoughts. Could there be any connection
between the visit of the two strangers and the trouble
over at Bayport? and where had Mr. Norton gone
during the previous evening? Had he spent the time
at the tavern?</p>

<p>I soon had a chance to solve the last question.
A tall, ragged fellow came along, and I recognized
him at once as Joe Kent, a ne’er-do-well of the
Bend.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Joe!” I sang out.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Rube,” he returned. “What brings you to
the Bend so early in the morning?”</p>

<p>“A little business, Joe. Tell me, were you over
at Bender’s tavern last evening?”</p>

<p>“What you want to know for?”</p>

<p>“I want to know who was there.”</p>

<p>“I was there from about eight o’clock till Bender
closed up.”</p>

<p>“Was there a tall stranger there?”</p>

<p>“No; only Bender, Hallett, Forms, and myself.”</p>

<p>“No one else?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“You are sure?”</p>

<p>“Of course I am. Why, what’s up?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, Joe. I am much obliged;” and I hurried
away before he could say any more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span></p>

<p>I walked down the main street hardly knowing
what to do next. In front of the post-office I met
Ford, who had just come from his home to look for
a job of some kind.</p>

<p>“Well, Rube, how do you make out with your
uncle?” he asked, as he jumped down from the
barrel upon which he had been sitting.</p>

<p>“Don’t call him my uncle, Dan,” I returned. “He
may be a relative according to law, but he isn’t in
heart.”</p>

<p>“Why, has he been after you again?”</p>

<p>“Rather,” I returned bitterly. And taking Ford
aside I told him of all that had occurred.</p>

<p>“The mean rascal!” exclaimed the ex-mill-hand.
“It would do me good to punch his head.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what to do,” I went on. “If I
go back he may do me up.”</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t if I was around,” replied Ford with
a decided shake of the head.</p>

<p>“I am satisfied that he is a wicked man at heart,”
I went on. “It is an awful surprise to me too,
because I always heard father speak well of him.”</p>

<p>“You can’t tell how some men will act when they
have a little power. He, no doubt, thinks he can
boss you just as he pleases.”</p>

<p>“Well, he’ll find out that he is mistaken.”</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence, and then Ford
said,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>“Tell you what to do, Rube. You go back and
I’ll go with you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Dan; but you will lose your time
by that.”</p>

<p>“A day or two won’t matter. It isn’t likely I’ll
strike anything at once, things are so dull.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Mr. Norton won’t have you around.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll sit on a rock on the other side of
the road,” laughed Ford. “He can’t stop me from
doing that.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you go back with me and keep out of
sight until I give you some sort of a signal,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“That’s an idea. If I show myself at once he’ll
keep in till I go away.”</p>

<p>We decided to act on this plan at once. There
was no telling when Squire Slocum would get back
from Bayport, and, strange as it may seem, I did
not like the idea of leaving Mr. Norton in sole
charge of the mill.</p>

<p>He knew nothing of the business, which must be
looked after; and besides, I was afraid to trust him.</p>

<p>We started at once. When in sight of the mill,
Ford stepped into the bushes, saying he would draw
up close on the water side, and if I needed him
to give a loud whistle.</p>

<p>This arranged, I walked boldly up to the mill<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
door and entered. Mr. Norton was nowhere to be
seen; but an instant later he appeared with a flushed
face.</p>

<p>“Oh, so you’ve concluded to come back,” he said.</p>

<p>“I didn’t intend to stay away for good,” I replied,
as lightly as possible, though I watched him
closely.</p>

<p>“Have you seen the squire?”</p>

<p>I paid no attention to this question, and presently
he repeated it.</p>

<p>“I was at the squire’s house,” I responded.</p>

<p>“And what did he say?” asked Mr. Norton, though
he did not appear to be as much interested as I supposed
would be likely.</p>

<p>I pretended not to hear, and passed into the living
room. Here on the table everything remained just
as I had left it. Mr. Norton had evidently no appetite
for breakfast.</p>

<p>“Did you hear my question?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I heard it.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you answer then?”</p>

<p>“Because I don’t choose to do so.”</p>

<p>I expected this would bring out another storm of
passion. But I was mistaken. Mr. Norton merely
shut his mouth hard, and walked up and down the
room.</p>

<p>“Reuben, you are smarter than I thought you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
were,” he said presently. “I thought you were a
mere backwoods boy, but I find I am mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Do you want your breakfast, sir?”</p>

<p>“No; I’m not hungry. You sit down and eat.”</p>

<p>I did so, and he walked around and eyed me
curiously.</p>

<p>“Reuben, your father died rather poor,” he continued.
“He was a hard worker, but he didn’t
know how to manage.”</p>

<p>“It was the hard times, and not the managing,”
I put in, eager to defend the parent I had just lost.</p>

<p>“When your father fell over the ravine, he and
I were just getting ready to make a pile of money,”
went on Mr. Norton slowly. “If he had lived two
months longer he would have been a rich man.”</p>

<p>In my wonder at this statement I stopped eating
at once.</p>

<p>“You must be joking,” I cried.</p>

<p>“No; it’s the sober truth. We had all our plans
ready when your father’s death upset everything. It
was a splendid scheme, and only needed a little nerve
to carry it out.”</p>

<p>“And what kind of a scheme was it?” I asked
eagerly, for this news was totally new to me.</p>

<p>“It’s the same one mentioned in those letters in my
valise,” replied Mr. Norton.</p>

<small>MR. NORTON’S STATEMENT.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I was more mystified than ever. Evidently Mr.
Norton still supposed that I had taken his bag and
examined its contents.</p>

<p>“What was the scheme?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you read the letters?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t even see them. Carney has the valise, as
well as the other things; and if you want to get the
stuff back you had better go after him.”</p>

<p>“You still stick to that statement?”</p>

<p>“Of course, for it’s the truth.”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton drew a long breath. I felt pretty certain
that at last he believed me.</p>

<p>“Well, if Carney did really steal the bag, why
didn’t you stop him?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t. He had a pistol, and he threatened
to shoot me if I moved out of the chair.”</p>

<p>“I ought to get that bag back,” he went on, with
a decided shake of his head.</p>

<p>“What was the scheme father and you had?” I
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>“Can you keep a secret?” questioned Mr. Norton
in a low voice.</p>

<p>“Certainly I can,” I replied, never dreaming of
what was coming.</p>

<p>“It was a plan to get hold of twenty thousand
dollars worth of bonds and cash,” whispered the man.</p>

<p>“How?” was all I could say.</p>

<p>“Out of the bank.”</p>

<p>“But how could you do it?” I asked innocently.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton looked at me with a sneer on his lips.</p>

<p>“Reuben, you’re a fool!” he cried. “You haven’t
any sand in you at all.”</p>

<p>“A little while ago you said I was pretty smart,”
I returned, for it seemed about the only thing to
say.</p>

<p>“You are in some ways, but in others you are as
blind as a mule. Of course, you don’t suppose the
bank officials would hand the amount right over if
it was asked for.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t see how father or you could get it,
unless you had that sum on deposit.”</p>

<p>“You don’t, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Then you’re a fool.”</p>

<p>And Mr. Norton turned on his heel.</p>

<p>Suddenly a wave of light broke over me. I
jumped to my feet, trembling from head to foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>“Do you mean to say you were going to steal
that money?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“Hush! not so loud.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t answering my question,” I went on,
ignoring his caution.</p>

<p>“We were going to get that money, that’s all I
have to say,” returned my guardian with a shrug
of his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you were, but not my father,” I cried,
with flashing eyes. “You will never make me believe
that he consented to do anything that was
wrong!”</p>

<p>“You don’t know anything about it,” retorted Mr.
Norton angrily. “Your father was hard up, and that
was the only way to get money. It was his plan,
not mine. I have always been an honest man, even
though I was poor.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Norton, you are a villain!” I cried in high
indignation. “My father never did a willfully wrong
action in his life, and I won’t allow you or any
other man to say he did.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, don’t get on a high horse,” replied
my guardian. “You know just how poor your father
was. His estate is deeply in my debt, and I want
the money paid. I have found out that there are
other claims against this mill, and that will leave you
without a penny. Now if you will only listen to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
me, I will put you in a way of getting so much that
you can leave work alone for a good while to
come.”</p>

<p>And the man placed his hand on my shoulder as
if to thus persuade me to accede to his wishes.</p>

<p>I threw the hand off.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare to touch me!” I cried. “You
are a bad man, and I will have nothing to do with
you. You may be my uncle, but you are so in law
only, and not in my heart.”</p>

<p>“Take care!” stormed Mr. Norton, now thoroughly
aroused. “I won’t allow any one, least of all a boy,
to talk to me like that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. I never liked you from the start,
and I want you to know it. I shall not consider
you my guardian any longer.”</p>

<p>“You won’t, eh?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I won’t.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll hand you over to the police the first
chance I get. I can tell them a fine story about you.”</p>

<p>At that instant a shadow fell across my window,
and looking up, we saw four men approaching the
mill. They were Constable Pointer, President Webster
of the Bayport Bank, and two strangers.</p>

<p>“Constable Pointer!” I exclaimed, as the quartet
filed in.</p>

<p>“Ha!” cried Mr. Norton, and I saw him turn
pale. “What do you men want here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>“Reuben, we want you,” said the constable, as he
placed his hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>“Want me!” I cried, starting back.</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“About that boat matter?” I asked.</p>

<p>“No, not about any boat matter,” put in President
Webster. “Constable, I demand that the boy be
searched.”</p>

<p>“What for?” I asked, and I saw that Mr. Norton
was equally curious to know.</p>

<p>There was no reply to this, and I backed away.</p>

<p>“Stop, Rube,” said Pointer. “Remember you are
now under arrest.”</p>

<p>“Arrest!” I gasped.</p>

<p>“Exactly, young man,” added Mr. Webster.
“Search him at once.”</p>

<p>I was too much taken aback to protest, and the
constable quickly turned my pockets inside out.</p>

<p>“Nothing much of value,” said Pointer.</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” questioned the president of the
bank eagerly.</p>

<p>The constable made another search, and finally
brought to light the stone I had picked up on the
floor.</p>

<p>“Here is one of ’em!” he cried. “By George,
Rube, to tell the honest truth, I didn’t think it of
you,” he added in a lower tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>“Didn’t think what of me?”</p>

<p>“That you would turn thief.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t done so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, it won’t do to deny this.”</p>

<p>“You say my nephew has turned thief?” put in
Mr. Norton, pressing forward.</p>

<p>“Are you this boy’s uncle?” asked President
Webster.</p>

<p>“Yes; and his guardian too.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity you wouldn’t guard him better,”
sneered the big man from Bayport.</p>

<p>“What has he stolen?” asked my guardian, with
apparent deep concern.</p>

<p>“He’s helped to steal a bag of diamonds from one
of the safes in the Bayport Bank,” returned Constable
Pointer. “Is this one of the stones, Mr. Ditson?”
he continued, turning to one of the strangers.</p>

<p>“I think it is,” was the reply, after an examination.
“What do you think, Mr. Camp?” he added
to the other stranger.</p>

<p>“I should say it was,” was the quick reply. “It
ought to be plain enough that such a boy would
never have a diamond of his own like this.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t steal that diamond!” I burst out.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you will state where you did get it?”
remarked Mr. Webster sarcastically.</p>

<p>“I found it here on the floor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>There was a general sniff at this.</p>

<p>“Quite likely!” said Mr. Ditson. “Diamonds are
not lying around so loosely as all that. I am pretty
sure, officer, you have got one of the thieves. The
question is, has he any more of the stones?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to search around and see,” said Pointer.</p>

<p>“Did you know your nephew was out last night?”
asked Mr. Webster of Mr. Norton sharply.</p>

<p>“Yes, he was,” replied my guardian.</p>

<p>“How long?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know when he came in,” was the answer.
“But, oh, sir, I cannot believe that he is a thief!”</p>

<p>And Mr. Norton’s voice trembled with apparent
emotion.</p>

<p>“And neither I am!” I cried. “He was out as
well as I was, and I found that stone right here
on the floor early this morning.”</p>

<p>“Too thin,” sneered Mr. Webster. “Hold him,
Pointer. Have we a right to search the house?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes; search all you please,” put in Mr.
Norton hastily. “If the dear boy has done wrong,
let it be made right as quickly as possible!”</p>

<p>At that moment Ford came in. He had seen the
crowd of men, and he wanted to know what was
up.</p>

<p>“Can’t make me believe that Rube stole any diamonds!”
he ejaculated, when he had heard the story.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
“I’d rather believe his uncle here was the guilty
party.”</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken before Mr. Norton had him
by the throat.</p>

<p>“You scamp!” he howled. “Call me a thief!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.<br>
<small>SOME FACTS IN THE CASE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I was completely dumfounded by the accusations
that were brought against me.</p>

<p>The constable and the others were sure in their
minds that I had stolen, or assisted at stealing, some
diamonds from one of the safes in the Bayport Bank.</p>

<p>How they had come to track me I did not know;
but I realized that the fact of my having that diamond
in my possession, would carry much weight against
me.</p>

<p>The story that I had found the stone upon the
floor of the living-room of the mill was not believed,
although it was the exact truth.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton’s manner put a sudden suspicion into
my mind. He had told a deliberate falsehood in
saying that I had been away from the mill the previous
night. He must certainly have come in while
I was sleeping in the rocker, and seen me.</p>

<p>He had spoken to me on the subject of obtaining
money dishonestly. To my mind no fair and square
man would have done so. Was Ford’s suspicion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
against him correct? I was half inclined to think
that such was the fact.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of my readers will think it odd that
I did not arrive at this conclusion sooner. Let them
remember that I was but a boy, and that the adventure
with the sloop, coupled with the news of
my father’s death and my guardian’s arrival, had
completely upset me. Had my mind been more at
ease I might have acted differently from the start.</p>

<p>“Let go of me!” cried Ford sternly.</p>

<p>And catching Mr. Norton by the arm he shoved
him several feet away.</p>

<p>“I won’t allow anybody to talk to me in this
fashion,” went on my guardian. “The idea of insinuating
that I know anything about this robbery!”</p>

<p>“Where did the boy spend the night?” asked
Pointer, as soon as he could get a chance to talk.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He didn’t come in till a little
while ago,” returned Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>“That isn’t so!” I exclaimed. “I was here from
half-past twelve until breakfast-time.”</p>

<p>“Where were you from seven o’clock yesterday until
half past twelve?” questioned Mr. Webster sharply.</p>

<p>“Here most of the time. I left about half-past
eleven to go after a fellow who stole some things
from the mill.”</p>

<p>“Another thief?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir. His name is Andy Carney. He came
here to get square with me on account of Mr. Williams’s
boat.”</p>

<p>“I know nothing about that,” returned the bank
president.</p>

<p>“Where are the two men that were with you,
Rube?” asked the constable.</p>

<p>“Two men with you?” repeated Mr. Norton, with
a slight start.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been with any two men,” I returned.
“I don’t know what you are talking about. Mr.
Norton was away last night, not I.”</p>

<p>“You bad boy! how can you say such a thing?”
burst out my guardian. “I haven’t been outside of
the mill since yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p>“That is not true! You went out right after
supper!”</p>

<p>“Come, come! this is wasting time,” said Mr. Ditson.
“Pointer, see if you can find any more of the
diamonds.”</p>

<p>“Will you look after the boy?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“You had better look after Mr. Norton,” I put in.</p>

<p>“What!” screamed that individual.</p>

<p>“My word ought to be as good as his,” I added.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” said Pointer. “I will have to arrest
both of you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span></p>

<p>“Arrest me!” ejaculated my guardian, and for
the moment all the color forsook his face.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. You will be a witness, if nothing else.
Will you go along peaceably?”</p>

<p>“Why—why—I suppose so,” stammered the man.
“But, nevertheless, it is an outrage.”</p>

<p>To this the constable did not reply, but went off
to search the mill for more precious stones.</p>

<p>While he was gone my thoughts were busy. Was
my guardian the guilty party? and were the two
strangers I had found at the mill his partners in
the crime? It seemed more than likely.</p>

<p>The thought was a dismaying one, almost as disheartening
to me at that instant as the fact that
I was under arrest. The only relative I possessed
in the world a criminal!</p>

<p>It was a bitter thought, and for the moment drove
everything else from my mind. Meanwhile Pointer
made a search of the mill and all the rooms without
success.</p>

<p>“If there are any more of these stones here they’re
well hidden,” he said. “Suppose we go to Squire
Slocum’s office, and have these two put in charge,
and then go after the men that helped on the burglary?”</p>

<p>This was considered good advice, and five minutes
later the mill was locked up and we all started<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
down the main road, Ford beside me, telling me to
keep up my courage, that he was sure I was innocent,
and that all would yet come right.</p>

<p>Half an hour later found us assembled in the
squire’s office, and a brief hearing began.</p>

<p>I told my story “as straight as a string.” Mr.
Norton tried to interrupt me a number of times,
but Squire Slocum promptly shut him up, and I
had a full hearing.</p>

<p>Then my guardian had his say. It was but little
more than has been told. Squire Slocum touched several
times on the fact that Mr. Norton had come to
the mill under rather peculiar circumstances, to which
that individual replied that that had nothing to do
with the case.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” replied the squire coldly.</p>

<p>“But I want that matter investigated too,” I put
in. “Squire Slocum, you were always a good friend
to my father, and I don’t know whether this man
is doing right or not according to law. I know he
hasn’t acted as a fair and square guardian ought to
do.”</p>

<p>“I will do so later, Reuben,” was the reply. “But
this has nothing to do with the case on hand. You
say you know nothing more, and that you feel sure
those two strangers are the guilty parties?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>“And that Mr. Norton and Carney are also implicated?”</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“The boy is a rascal!” shouted my guardian.
“He is—”</p>

<p>“Silence!” put in the squire. “I want no more
interruptions from you.”</p>

<p>“Then I don’t want you to allow that boy—”</p>

<p>“Stop!” thundered Squire Slocum, who could get
awfully mad at times. “Fuller,” he went on to one
of the officers, “take this man to the jail.”</p>

<p>“To the jail!” cried Mr. Norton, falling back in
astonishment. “What have I done?”</p>

<p>“You are wanted as a witness, besides being impertinent.
You shall have another hearing this afternoon,
or sooner if the other thieves are caught.”</p>

<p>“Other thieves! Do you consider—”</p>

<p>“I should have said the two thieves Pointer and
the other officers are looking for,” corrected the
squire. “Fuller, take Mr. Norton to jailer Harris.”</p>

<p>And much against his will, my guardian was led
out of the court room, quite a crowd following.</p>

<p>“Reuben, I am sorry to see that you are mixed
up in this case,” went on Squire Slocum in a lower
tone.</p>

<p>“I am not guilty, Squire. I never helped to steal
anything in my life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>“But the case looks black for you,” was the
grave reply. “We have some strong evidence
against you to hold you—”</p>

<p>“You mean the diamond I found?”</p>

<p>“Not only that, but a number of other things.”</p>

<p>“I should like to know what evidence you have?”</p>

<p>“Your boat was over at Bayport last night, and
did not leave until after two o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Norton must have used it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe, but that is not at present for me to decide.
Then there are other things—”</p>

<p>“What other things?”</p>

<p>“A small iron bar used to pry open the safe door
was found, and it had your father’s name stamped
upon it.”</p>

<p>“That is one that belonged to the mill. Mr.
Norton or any one else might have carried it off.”</p>

<p>“But you were seen, Reuben, in Bayport at
eleven o’clock last night, and you say you were
not there at all.”</p>

<p>“Seen!” I cried. “No, no, Squire! Who says
so?”</p>

<p>“Several people. They saw you on Maple Avenue,
right near the bank.”</p>

<p>“It was not I.”</p>

<p>“These people are sure it was. Then President
Webster remembered seeing you at the bank a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
days ago, and he says the janitor remembers that
you hung around a good deal, just at the time Mr.
Ditson delivered the diamonds to him.”</p>

<p>“I was waiting for Mr. Markham, who had promised
me a reward for saving his son from drowning.”</p>

<p>“But this Markham was a very peculiar man,”
went on Squire Slocum. “Webster thinks he might
have had something to do with the robbery, although
we cannot tell anything about it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he did. I think there is some
mistake about Mr. Markham’s account, but that is all.
He was a gentleman, if I am any judge.”</p>

<p>“We shall see. In the meantime I must place you
under arrest.”</p>

<p>“Will you let me know as soon as these two men
are found?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>At this moment constable Pointer came in, and the
squire told him to take me to the jailer, to be put in
a cell apart from Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>Feeling pretty downhearted, I followed Pointer
from the office to the rooms below. Here Mr. Harris,
the jailer, met us, and I was given over into his
charge.</p>

<p>“We’ll make you as comfortable as possible,” said
the jailer kindly. “I know what it is to be falsely
imprisoned, if that is your case. You shall have the
best cell in the building, Rube.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>“What have you done with Mr. Norton?”</p>

<p>“Put him in a corner by himself. He raised such
a fearful row.”</p>

<p>A moment more and I was shown into a narrow
cell, the door was closed and locked behind me, and
I was a prisoner.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.<br>
<small>A FRIEND IN NEED.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I was a prisoner in the Bend Center jail. It was
far from being a pleasant situation, and with a heavy
heart I sank down into a seat and gave myself up to
my bitter feelings.</p>

<p>For the past few days misfortunes had been piling
themselves upon me, and I could not help but wonder
what the end would be, or when it would be reached.</p>

<p>My prison was a cold, stony place, scarcely eight
feet square, and lighted by one narrow window, heavily
barred, and facing a high brick wall a few feet beyond.</p>

<p>At first I entertained some wild hope of trying
to escape. The iron bars at the window were loose
in the sill, and I was sure that by using all the
strength at my command I could remove at least
two of them, and thus make a space wide enough
to allow the passage of my body.</p>

<p>I was on the point of putting this plan into execution
when I paused and reflected that such a course
would avail me nothing! I did not want to leave
the district altogether, and to thus break jail would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
only be taken as an evidence that I was guilty of
the crime charged against me.</p>

<p>So I sat down again, resolved to take matters as
calmly as I could. There seemed to be no other
prisoners in the building outside of Mr. Norton and
myself; and after Squire Slocum and the crowd had
left all became as silent as a graveyard.</p>

<p>I wondered what my guardian was doing and
thinking. Certainly nothing good; for I was convinced
beyond a doubt that Mr. Norton was a
thorough rascal.</p>

<p>Presently I heard a slight scraping sound far down
the corridor. I hoped fervently that Pointer or some
of the other officers would capture the two strangers,—Avery
and Yates,—and recover the stolen diamonds.</p>

<p>At noon Mr. Harris, the jailer, brought me my
dinner. I asked him a number of questions, but he
politely but firmly declined to answer them.</p>

<p>“Can’t do it, prisoner,” he said. “It’s against
the rules.”</p>

<p>And I was left alone once more.</p>

<p>At length, about the middle of the afternoon, I
heard a noise in the squire’s office overhead. Several
men had entered, and a loud and rapid conversation
was in progress. I listened, and was almost
certain I distinguished the voice of Mr. Markham.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span></p>

<p>For some reason my heart gave a bound of joy.
I felt sure he had come to assist me, notwithstanding
all that had been said against him.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed; then there was a noise on
the stairs, and a moment later Squire Slocum, the
jailer, and Mr. Markham appeared.</p>

<p>“Well, my young friend, I see they have thought
best to lock you up,” remarked Mr. Markham lightly,
as he stepped into the cell and extended his hand
to me cordially.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Markham, they have,” was all I could
say.</p>

<p>He gave my hand a tight grasp.</p>

<p>“You are having a pile of trouble,” he went on,
“and partly on my account.”</p>

<p>“Why, you have nothing to do with the robbery,”
I put in quickly.</p>

<p>“No, not exactly,” he laughed; “but I have
caused you trouble enough in other ways.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would straighten out matters some
time,” I could not help replying. “I knew you
were a gentleman, no matter what Mr. Webster or
any one else said to the contrary.”</p>

<p>“Webster is a fool!” cried Mr. Markham with
energy. “A downright fool, and I told him so.
Just because I had a slight trouble with my bank
account, brought on by my clerk, he takes it for
granted that I am a swindler.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>And Mr. Markham’s eyes flashed, and he showed
plainly that he was thoroughly aroused.</p>

<p>“I came back to Bayport to-day, in reply to a
pretty sharp letter I received from Mr. Williams,”
he went on. “I had important business in New
York, but when I saw what an awful mess things
had got into here I took the first train. Williams
was another of the idiots that thought I was going
to swindle him simply because I left in a great hurry
without writing him a check.”</p>

<p>“And he was convinced I was trying to rob him
of his boat,” I said.</p>

<p>“So I have heard. But I have fixed that matter
all up with him. The boat is paid for, and is at
this moment lying at the wharf here in Bend Center.
She is your property, and here is the bill of sale for
her.”</p>

<p>And Mr. Markham pulled an envelope from his
pocket and passed it over.</p>

<p>With hands that trembled I took the bill of sale
and glanced it over. True enough, it certified that
for the sum of four hundred dollars the Catch Me
was now the sole property of Reuben Stone.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mr. Markham,” I said. “I—I—can’t
say more, but I am—I am—”</p>

<p>“Don’t try to say more,” laughed the gentleman.
“I am ashamed of myself to think that my gift should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
have cost you so much trouble. But you shall lose
nothing by me. I have not forgotten what more I
intended to do for you.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Markham, about this other matter,”
broke in Squire Slocum, who had thus far remained
silent.</p>

<p>“True, Squire, excuse me for keeping you waiting.
Stone, I am told that they hold you on a very serious
charge.”</p>

<p>“They do,” I returned. “But I am not guilty, sir.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look like a fellow who would steal.”</p>

<p>“I never took a thing that didn’t belong to me in
my life, sir.”</p>

<p>“I believe you.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Webster thinks I am guilty, but I know
nothing of the matter; that is, nothing but what I
have told. Mr. Webster also insinuates that you
might have had something to do with it,” I added,
bound that Mr. Markham should know all.</p>

<p>“I heard something of that sort. I have also heard
that there is a streak of insanity in the Webster
family,” he added, with a twinkle in his eye that
made even Squire Slocum smile. “He is so upset
by this robbery that he doesn’t know what he is
doing. I suppose he would accuse the President if
it came into his head.”</p>

<p>“He says you were in the office when Mr. Ditson<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
brought in the diamonds, and that you overheard him
say that they would be safe in the old vault as
long as the safe of the jeweler was being repaired,”
explained the squire.</p>

<p>“I remember seeing a gentleman come in with a
small bag,” replied Mr. Markham; “but I paid no
attention to what he had to say or what was done
with the bag; I was too excited over my own affairs.”</p>

<p>“Then the diamonds belonged to Mr. Ditson and
Mr. Camp?” I asked, for I was still in the dark on
this point.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Squire Slocum. “They are a couple
of jewelers that were stopping at the Bayport Grand
Hotel with some diamonds for several parties who are
putting up there, or were to come. They left the
diamonds at the bank for safe keeping. Mr. Webster
says you saw Mr. Ditson with the stones.”</p>

<p>“If I did I don’t remember it,” I replied. “The
janitor was very rude to me, and I soon went outside
and stood by the gutter till Mr. Markham came
out.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Webster told me you had a diamond in your
possession.”</p>

<p>“I am willing to swear that I picked the stone
up on the mill floor. It was dropped there either by
Mr. Norton or Andy Carney, or else somebody that
came in while I was asleep. I know that statement
sounds rather queer, but it’s the plain truth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>“You certainly stick to it,” commented the squire.</p>

<p>“I believe the young man,” said Mr. Markham.
“And now, since I have caused him so much trouble,
I think it my duty to see if I cannot help him. Can
you let him out on bail?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Squire Slocum slowly. “We
haven’t had a regular hearing yet.”</p>

<p>“If I’m let out I’ll be on hand whenever wanted,”
I put in quickly.</p>

<p>“Suppose you see what can be done,” said Mr.
Markham. “I will bear all the expense, Squire, and
I guess I can convince you I am perfectly reliable,
even if Webster won’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“Let us go over to Judge Green’s office in Bayport,”
said Squire Slocum. “Maybe we can fix it
up. I wouldn’t care to take the responsibility
alone.”</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and the two went off at once,
and the jailer locked me in once more.</p>

<p>But I was now lighter hearted and time passed
quickly. Three hours later Mr. Markham and the
squire returned, and I was let out under five thousand
dollars bail.</p>

<p>The necessary papers had hardly been made out
in Squire Slocum’s office when the jailer rushed in
pale as a ghost.</p>

<p>“Norton has escaped!” he ejaculated.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.<br>
<small>BACK TO THE MILL.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>For the moment there was intense excitement among
the half-dozen men who were present. The escape of
a prisoner from Bend Center was an unheard-of occurrence,
and for a while nobody seemed to know what
to do.</p>

<p>“Norton escaped!” ejaculated the squire, jumping
up from his chair.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the jailer.</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“Some time within the past two hours.”</p>

<p>“How was it accomplished?”</p>

<p>“Broke three of the iron bars out of the window,
and climbed the wall into Dr. Sand’s garden.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea where the man has gone
to?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes the bell over the village hall
was rung, the news was spread that Mr. Norton had
escaped, and a reward of fifty dollars was offered for
his capture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span></p>

<p>“I take it that he is guilty,” said Mr. Markham,
as we stood in the squire’s office. “It is rather rough
on you, Stone, but that is what I think.”</p>

<p>“I think so myself, sir,” I replied. “But, Mr.
Markham, allow me to thank you for your kindness
in going my bail. I didn’t expect it. Aren’t you
afraid I will run away?”</p>

<p>“No, I am not. I can read faces, and I take yours
to be an honest one.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir. I’ll promise not to run away.”</p>

<p>“What do you intend to do?” he went on. “I
must get back to New York and get ready to go to
Philadelphia first thing to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“You have spent a good deal of time on me, sir.
I expect to go back to the mill.”</p>

<p>At that moment two men came up.</p>

<p>“They’ve found out that Norton started up the
road to Hillsburg,” said one of the men. “I reckon
he is going to try to make the midnight train if possible.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity you can’t telegraph, and head him off,”
said Mr. Markham.</p>

<p>“There are no wires through the Bend,” was the
reply. “The place is behind in some things.”</p>

<p>I was silent. Was it true that Mr. Norton intended
to shake the dust of the district from his feet for
good?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span></p>

<p>I could not help but wish that such was a fact.
Not but what I wanted to see the guilty parties punished,
but I desired to have nothing more to do
with the man, and would be perfectly content if he
would never again approach me. I considered that I
was old enough to take care of myself, and wanted
no guardian of any kind excepting such a nominal
one as the law might require.</p>

<p>A few moments later Mr. Markham and I walked
down to the dock at which the Catch Me was lying.
Mr. Williams had put the craft in first-class trim
once more, and as I stepped on board I could not
help but feel my breast swell with pride as I realized
that I was the owner.</p>

<p>“I will take you to Bayport if you wish,” I
said.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Stone; I would like to get over there
as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>I hoisted the sails at once, and stood out for the opposite
shore. On the way we had quite a talk; and
when Mr. Markham fairly wrung the information
from me that business was poor at the mill, and
that money was tight, he got out two twenty dollar
bills, and insisted on my taking them “on account,”
as he put it.</p>

<p>“You are too generous,” I said, as he thrust the
bills into my pocket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span></p>

<p>“It is only a part of what I intended to give
you from the start. I shall never forget what you
have done for me.”</p>

<p>We parted at the Bayport pier, and then I steered
for the mouth of the Torrent Bend River. As I
skimmed over the surface of the lake I reviewed my
situation in all its details.</p>

<p>I resolved that as soon as the mystery of the
diamond robbery was cleared up, to put my father’s
matters in Squire Slocum’s hands for final settlement;
then if I was allowed to run the mill I
would do so, and hire Ford as a regular man to
help me.</p>

<p>During the days that grinding was slack I could
go fishing in the boat, or, better yet, hire out the
craft to such parties at the Bayport hotels as wished
to charter her. I knew there was money in doing
this, and money was what I was after.</p>

<p>It was dark when I ran up to the mill landing.
Not a light was to be seen about the place. I
fastened the Catch Me by means of a chain with
a lock and key—a thing that gave me much satisfaction,
as I thought it would now be no easy matter
to run off with my property.</p>

<p>I approached the mill silently, and pushed open
the door of the grinding-room. As I did so I fancied
I heard the faint murmur of voices.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>I stopped short and listened. I had not been
mistaken; and I judged the sounds came from the
room under the living apartments.</p>

<p>For a second I knew not what to do; then I
tiptoed my way across the floor to one of the bedrooms,
and carefully raised up one of the boards
that I knew was loose.</p>

<p>The rays of a small lantern met my eyes; and by
the light I saw that two men were in the room.
One was the man called Yates, and the other was
Mr. Enos Norton.</p>

<p>My surprise at seeing the latter was intense. With
all the others at the Bend, I had felt sure my guardian
had made his way to Hillsburg to take the
midnight train.</p>

<p>“It was a risky thing to come back here,” I heard
Yates say.</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” replied Mr. Norton. “No one
would think I would dare to come back; and I left
the impression behind that I had gone towards Hillsburg.”</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t do to stay here long.”</p>

<p>“I know that. That’s the reason I say let us
settle up at once, and clear out. This haul hasn’t
been half what I thought it would be, and I want
the matter ended.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pity you broke jail,” went on Yates, with a
sniff. “That was a give-away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>“I know it; but things were getting too hot. That
boy is smarter than he looks.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! You are losing all nerve. Hist! here
comes some one.”</p>

<p>The light went out instantly. Then a voice was
heard saying it was all right. The light was turned
on again, and I saw that the man called Avery had
entered.</p>

<p>“All right?” asked the other two.</p>

<p>“There’s a boat at the dock,” replied Avery in a
whisper.</p>

<p>“Who’s aboard?”</p>

<p>“No one.”</p>

<p>“Is it that Carney’s boat?” asked Mr. Norton
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think it is. It’s a larger craft.”</p>

<p>“Then it must belong to the police!” cried Yates.
“We must get right out of here.”</p>

<p>“But about dividing those stones?” asked Avery.</p>

<p>“We can’t do it now. Remember, we lost one the
other night in our hurry; it won’t do to lose more.”</p>

<p>“Then come.”</p>

<p>The three at once left the room. I heard them
cross the road and strike out for the shore above, and
then with my heart beating rapidly I stole after them.</p>

<p>It was intensely dark, and it was with difficulty that
I kept them in sight; but they moved slowly, and
that was in my favor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>At length we reached the shore above the mill.
Here a small boat was lying, and the three prepared
to go on board.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Norton uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! I’ve forgotten something!”</p>

<p>“What’s that?” asked Yates.</p>

<p>“There is something at the mill I want to take
along. Will you wait till I run back for it?”</p>

<p>“It’s risky,” said Avery.</p>

<p>“I’ll run the chance. If I get caught I’ll give the
alarm.”</p>

<p>And with this the man jumped back to shore, and
made for the very place where I was in hiding.</p>

<p>I tried to spring to one side; but in doing so I
made considerable noise. It was heard, and a moment
later the man recognized me.</p>

<p>“Reuben!” he ejaculated. “When did you escape?”</p>

<p>Without replying I made for the mill. But Mr.
Norton was after me, and as I reached the door he
collared me.</p>

<p>“When did you escape?” he repeated.</p>

<p>“I got out just a little while before you did,” I
replied; and I did not see the necessity of adding
that I was on bail.</p>

<p>“And what are you doing here?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“That is my business.”</p>

<p>“You have been spying on us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>I was silent.</p>

<p>“Is that your boat down at the pier?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You are alone?”</p>

<p>“Why do you ask that question?”</p>

<p>“Answer me.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care to.”</p>

<p>He eyed me savagely.</p>

<p>“You had better!” he cried. “Do you know you
are in my power, boy?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, you are.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see it,” I replied stoutly.</p>

<p>“You are smart, but not smart enough,” went on
Mr. Norton; “and I want to know at once whether
you are with us or against us.”</p>

<p>“I will never side with a set of thieves!” I burst
out warmly, indignant at such a proposition.</p>

<p>“Well, then, suit yourself,” he replied.</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken before he sprang upon me.
I was taken by surprise, and before I could realize
it I was on my back and he was on top of me.</p>

<p>“Let me up!” I cried.</p>

<p>“Not much. If you want to be an enemy to your
own uncle and his friends be so; but you have got
to take the consequences.”</p>

<p>We had a short struggle after this without more
words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>I did my best to get away, but it was useless.
Mr. Norton was thoroughly aroused, and his muscles
were like iron. Drawing back his hand, he hit me
between the eyes, and before I could recover he
caught up a rope and bound me hand and foot.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.<br>
<small>A MOMENT OF EXCITEMENT.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Now we’ll see who is master here!” cried Mr.
Norton, after he had succeeded in rendering me powerless.</p>

<p>“What do you intend to do?” I asked in alarm.</p>

<p>“Never mind; you will find out quick enough,
never fear.”</p>

<p>Saying this, Mr. Norton dragged me into the mill,
and up the stairs into the grain-bin.</p>

<p>“Now stay there until you free yourself,” he said
harshly. “And remember that I am not to be overcome
by a boy like you.”</p>

<p>“You are a villain,” was all I could say in return.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so; but I won’t have you talking to me
like that,” he returned.</p>

<p>And raising his heavy boot, he gave me a kick in
the side that caused me to cry out with pain.</p>

<p>“Now good-by to you,” he went on. “You will
never see me again.”</p>

<p>“I trust I never shall,” I replied bitterly.</p>

<p>In a moment he was gone and I was left to my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
own reflections. I heard him tramp around down-stairs
for several minutes, and then all became silent.</p>

<p>No sooner had he left me than I began to tug at
the ropes that bound me. But Mr. Norton had done
his work well, and at the end of five minutes I found
myself as secure as ever.</p>

<p>I was lying flat on my back, and found it impossible
to rise. For a while I thought to raise my
voice, and did so several times, but then ceased under
the impression that no one was within hearing
distance.</p>

<p>A rat came out of his hole and scrambled over
my legs. This startled me, and I raised quite a
racket which made him disappear in a hurry.</p>

<p>Ten minutes passed, and all was as silent as before.
Would I have to lie there until morning, or longer,
and leave the three robbers to escape? It seemed
more than likely.</p>

<p>Presently I thought I heard a sound at the door
of the lower mill room. I listened intently and was
sure I was not mistaken.</p>

<p>“Help! help!” I cried at the top of my lungs.</p>

<p>The sound stopped, and I repeated my calls.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” cried a voice.</p>

<p>“It is I, Reuben Stone.”</p>

<p>“Where are you?”</p>

<p>“Up in the grain-bin.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>“Are you alone?” was asked; and now I recognized
Ford’s tones.</p>

<p>“Yes, Dan; come up and untie me.”</p>

<p>At once there was a tramping on the stairs, and
then Ford appeared, carrying one of the mill lanterns.</p>

<p>“Why, Reuben, who put you here?” he exclaimed,
as he bent down and freed me.</p>

<p>“Mr. Norton.”</p>

<p>“Your uncle? Why I thought he had sneaked away
to Hillsburg.”</p>

<p>“So does everybody else,” I returned, as I jumped
to my feet. “But he was here less than half an
hour ago with those other two thieves.”</p>

<p>“You don’t tell me! Where have they gone?”</p>

<p>“They have a boat up in the cove above. They
are going to some point on the lake.”</p>

<p>“Phew! Lucky I came along.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dan, lucky for me. What brought you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I got to thinking that it wasn’t right to
let the mill stand alone, and I told mother I was
going over and take possession for you till everything
was straightened out.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Dan; it’s a good deal to do, and so
late at night too. Do you know what I have a
mind to do?” I added suddenly.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>“Follow these men. I know they are the three
robbers, and even if one of them is my uncle, I want
them brought to justice.”</p>

<p>“Have you got a boat?”</p>

<p>“Yes; the Catch Me. Mr. Markham has straightened
everything out, and the boat is mine.”</p>

<p>“Good! Well, if you go after them, I will go
along. It isn’t safe for you to go alone.”</p>

<p>“Thanks. I would like to have you along first-rate.”</p>

<p>“Where is your boat?”</p>

<p>“Down at the dock.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see her as I came up.”</p>

<p>“She is there—unless Mr. Norton took her,” I
added, with a sudden sinking of the heart.</p>

<p>“I’m positive there was no boat there when I
came up, for I looked for the regular mill sloop.”</p>

<p>By this time we had gone down-stairs. I rushed
outside and down to the pier. Sure enough the Catch
Me had disappeared.</p>

<p>I gave a groan as I made the discovery. Ford
shook his head.</p>

<p>“Mr. Norton is a bad man and no mistake. He’s
the kind of a relative that no one wants,” he exclaimed
decidedly.</p>

<p>“You are right, Dan. I would rather be alone in
the world ten times over than have him for my uncle.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
How my father ever took up with him in the West
I cannot imagine.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he hid his real nature when he was with
your father,” suggested Ford. “Smart rogues can do
that very easily, you know.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t deceive me much. I didn’t like him
from the start.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. But you know your father was a very
easy-going man.”</p>

<p>“He never wrote to me about Mr. Norton,” I returned;
and then to change the subject, which was
so disagreeable to me, I went on, “but the question
is now, what is best to do?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Suppose we take a look up and
down the shore for the boat. He most likely went
off with those other men and merely sent the Catch
Me adrift.”</p>

<p>“True. We will make an examination. You can
go down the shore, and I will go up. The signal
to come will be a whistle, or in case of danger the
hoot of an owl.”</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and we separated at once. I
started along the shore very slowly, keeping my eyes
open, and stopping often to scan the darkness that
overhung Rock Island Lake.</p>

<p>At length I reached the spot where the boat belonging
to the thieves had been lying. It was gone, and
not a trace of where.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>I, however, for some reason, decided that the trio
had embarked for Rock Island. Perhaps I was mistaken,
but I thought that the most likely place for
such men to seek. The island was a wild and rocky
place, and provided they could get enough to eat and
drink, they could stay there a month without the
authorities discovering their hiding-place.</p>

<p>As I walked on, I wondered what Andy Carney
had had to do with the whole affair, and what had
become of the fellow and the stuff he had taken from
the mill. I was particularly anxious about the valise,
and the letters he had said it contained. I was sure
they related in some manner to my affairs, and if I
had them would not have hesitated to read them on
the spot.</p>

<p>At length I reached the place where the shore
became marshy, and then I concluded to retrace my
steps, satisfied that nothing could be gained by proceeding
farther.</p>

<p>I had hardly decided on this point before I heard
Ford whistle, not once, but several times.</p>

<p>I turned, and picked my way back as fast as I
could.</p>

<p>Ford continued to whistle, and I answered him.</p>

<p>“Rube! Rube!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“I’m coming!” I returned.</p>

<p>“Hurry up!” he shouted. “Hurry! hurry!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>“I’m coming as fast as I can,” I cried, and I pressed
forward as quickly as the rocks and the undergrowth
would permit.</p>

<p>“Something is the matter,” went on Ford. “We
must have help as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“What’s up?” I asked, as I bounded into the
clearing that surrounded the mill.</p>

<p>“The mill is on fire! Just look at that end of
the roof and the top of the shed!”</p>

<p>I started, and did as directed. Sure enough it was
as Ford said. The building was afire in two distinct
places!</p>

<p>“Mr. Norton did that!” I burst out.</p>

<p>“I believe you. He meant to burn you up alive.
What a scoundrel he is!”</p>

<p>“What can we do, Dan?” I asked, with my heart
in my throat as I thought of the destruction of the
mill portion of my father’s estate. “Can we put it
out?”</p>

<p>“Put it out! I guess not. Just look at those
flames, getting bigger and bigger every minute! I
am afraid Mr. Norton did his work so well that the
old mill is doomed!”</p>

<p>“We must put it out!” I cried. “We can’t let
the mill go down in this fashion. We must get
water and a ladder or something, and put the fire
out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll do anything you say, Rube, but I don’t think
you can. Better try to save some of the things in
the rooms.”</p>

<p>“No; I’m either going to save the mill or nothing,”
I returned with a grim determination.</p>

<p>And I dashed off to see what I could do towards
subduing the flames, which were each instant growing
more fierce and destructive.</p>

<small>LIVELY WORK.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The mill was afire in two places, and unless something
was done very quickly the conflagration would
be beyond all control, and the place would be consumed.</p>

<p>With a cry to Ford to follow me, I dashed into
the lower room and brought out a couple of pails
that stood handy.</p>

<p>“Here are pails,” I said. “Can you reach down
and fill at the wheel? I’ll go and raise the ladder
to the shed.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Ford. “Wish there was somebody
here to help us.”</p>

<p>“I’ll fire the gun,” I went on.</p>

<p>And bringing the weapon out I did so.</p>

<p>Then I ran around to the other side of the building,
where a long ladder was lying, and raised this up
to the shed top. By this time Ford had the water;
and climbing up I poured it over the burning woodwork.</p>

<p>“Good!” shouted the mill-hand. “Throw down
the pails, and I’ll fill them again!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span></p>

<p>I did so. While he was gone I stripped off my
coat and beat some of the fire out as best I could.
When he returned I soaked the coat before throwing
the water on the flames, and before long I had the
fire on the shed completely extinguished.</p>

<p>But meanwhile the flames on the main roof had
gained considerable headway. I raised the ladder,
but found it would be too short to be of service.</p>

<p>“Can’t do anything with the ladder!” I cried.
“We’ll have to get at the fire from the inside.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be smothered,” remonstrated Ford.</p>

<p>“I hope not; any way, I’m going to try it.”</p>

<p>Taking a pail in each hand, I entered the mill and
dashed up the narrow stairway, and into the garret
room. Here all was thick with smoke, and at one
end I could see the flames.</p>

<p>Rushing up, I dashed all the water on the flames.
It took as long as I could hold my breath, and then
I ran to the open window and yelled to Ford.</p>

<p>“Fill the pails, Dan, and bring them up to the
door!”</p>

<p>He caught the pails as I threw them down, and
dashed off. Meanwhile I cleaned out the corner
where the fire was located, and stamped out some of
the flames with my feet. It was hot work, and dangerous,
but in my excitement I gave the matter no
thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span></p>

<p>Pretty soon the door opened, and Ford appeared
with more water. This I was careful to throw where
it would do the most good, and saw with delight
that we had somewhat checked the progress of the
conflagration.</p>

<p>“Two or four more will do the work,” I said. “I
will go down with you.”</p>

<p>And down we went, three steps at a time, he leading.
I knew where there was a big tin wash-boiler,
and got this.</p>

<p>Under ordinary circumstances it would have been
impossible for me to carry the boiler full of water, but
now I lifted it with ease, under the excitement of
the moment. I was close behind Ford; and we did
our best to make every gill of water count.</p>

<p>“We’ve got the best of the fire!” he exclaimed as
he brushed the perspiration from his face. “Two
more pails and it will be drowned out completely.”</p>

<p>While he was gone I made a minute examination,
to see that no sparks were lodged where they could
do harm. All such I knocked out with my wet
coat. When Ford returned, he also went over the
ground; and both of us declared the fire was out.</p>

<p>“And I never thought we could do it,” he panted.
“Rube, you deserve credit!”</p>

<p>“Not a bit more than you, Dan. But it was
tough work. Let us get out into the fresh air.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>The shot from the gun had brought no one to the
spot. We went down-stairs, and seated ourselves on
the stump of a tree on the opposite side of the road,
where we could see at once if there was any breaking
out of the fire again; and here we took a long
rest, and got some pure air into our lungs.</p>

<p>“There is no doubt in my mind but that Norton
intended to burn you up,” remarked Ford as he took
a deep breath.</p>

<p>“I think so myself,” I replied with a shudder;
“but oh, what a horrible thought that is!”</p>

<p>“He is a thoroughly bad egg,” went on my helper.
“Even if he ever gets out of this scrape, which I
don’t believe, I wouldn’t have anything to do with
him.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to,” I replied. “I shall never
claim him as my uncle, you may be sure of that.”</p>

<p>When we rested and got over the effects of the
smoke, we entered the mill, and made ourselves comfortable
in the living-room. We talked over the
damage that had been done, and reached the conclusion
that it could be repaired by ourselves.</p>

<p>“And as you have some shingles on the place, it
won’t cost you a cent of money,” said Ford.</p>

<p>I told him I intended to remain at the mill over
night, and he readily agreed to stay with me. I
hung up my wet coat to dry, and then both of us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
retired, but slept, as the saying is, “with one eye
open” until sunrise.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you intend to do now?” asked
Ford as we sat down to breakfast.</p>

<p>“I’m going to hunt up the Catch Me,” I replied.
“I am worried for fear Mr. Norton has misused
her out of sheer revenge.”</p>

<p>“You said Mr. Markham had given her to you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. He settled with Mr. Williams.”</p>

<p>And I told my helper the whole story.</p>

<p>“And I want to find the Catch Me, and see if
she’s all right; for I expect to make quite a sum of
money out of her during the summer. When we
are not very busy, I intend to leave you in charge
of the mill, and to go fishing, or rent out the boat
to the hotel boarders.”</p>

<p>“A good idea. But I fancy you won’t do much
till this robbery is cleared up.”</p>

<p>“I suppose not.”</p>

<p>“Remember, you are only out on bail. They may
make out a case against you when it comes to
trial.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how they can. I had nothing to do
with the robbery.”</p>

<p>“But they found the diamond on you, and Norton
may swear that you were with the crowd. He
seemed mean enough for anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span></p>

<p>We had soon finished breakfast; indeed, Ford’s
last words took away all my appetite, and then we
started for the lake.</p>

<p>“I intend to follow the shore all the way to the
Bend,” I said. “If I do not come across the Catch
Me before that time, I will borrow some boat and
take a sail around the lake.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea. Of course you want me to
go along.”</p>

<p>“If you will, Dan. I will pay you the same as
if you were working up at the mill.”</p>

<p>“Don’t want any pay, Rube. I want to see you
squared up and in full possession of your own.”</p>

<p>I had locked up the mill securely, and hung out the
slate for any orders that might come in. Then we
started down the lake shore, keeping our eyes wide
open for anything unusual that might present itself.</p>

<p>“They are a sly crowd,” remarked Ford as we
hurried along. “It is my opinion that the three had
this matter planned out before your uncle ever came
to the Bend.”</p>

<p>“It would seem so,” I returned. “But I don’t
understand it. Mr. Norton came as soon as he could
after my father’s death.”</p>

<p>“Maybe he had something to do with your father’s
death,” suggested my helper. “A man who would
try to burn up a boy wouldn’t stop at anything.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<p>I shuddered. The idea was so horrible I could
not reply.</p>

<p>We skirted the cove where the stranger’s boat had
been tied up several days before. Here, as I have
said, the bushes were heavy, and any craft could be
well hidden.</p>

<p>“I would like to know what they have done with
my old boat,” I said, as we peered right and left.
“She wasn’t worth much, but she would be mighty
handy just now.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” replied Ford.</p>

<p>Then he gave a sudden start, plunged ahead, and
disappeared around some rocks.</p>

<p>“Hi! what are you doing way in there?” I cried.</p>

<p>He did not reply, and I went after him. Suddenly
he returned, and laying his hand on my shoulder,
cautioned me to silence.</p>

<p>“What is it?” I whispered.</p>

<p>He shook his head to indicate he was not sure.</p>

<p>Then as silently as possible we picked our way
through the bushes that lined the inlet. We passed
on fully fifty feet, and then Ford stopped and pointed
ahead.</p>

<p>“I don’t see anything.”</p>

<p>“Look over to your left, Rube.”</p>

<p>“Beyond the blackberry bushes?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span></p>

<p>I looked, and saw a boat hidden behind some trees.
It was a strange looking craft, and I was for the
moment disappointed to think that it was not the
mill boat or the Catch Me.</p>

<p>“Whose boat?” I whispered.</p>

<p>“It is Andy Carney’s,” answered Ford. “Keep
quiet until we find out if he is anywhere around.”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX.<br>
<small>WE MAKE A PRISONER.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I was astonished by Ford’s words and came very
near uttering a sudden cry; but my helper pressed
his hand over my mouth, thus effectually preventing
any sound from coming forth.</p>

<p>“Carney may be around,” he went on softly; “and
if so we must try to capture him.”</p>

<p>I nodded; and then we continued our way towards
the boat.</p>

<p>I had brought the gun with me, and now I examined
it to see if it was in condition for immediate
use. I was aware of the desperate character of the
man with whom we had to deal, and I did not intend
to run any more chances than were necessary.</p>

<p>Presently we heard a noise to the left, and Carney
appeared. He carried a pail of spring water, and
with this went on board his boat.</p>

<p>“We’ve got him,” whispered Ford. “Stand by to
shoot if necessary, or else give me the gun.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of the gun. Let us creep up and
surprise him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll go ahead, and call on him to surrender, while
you point the gun at his head. That will bring
him to terms,” said Ford.</p>

<p>And he jumped aboard Carney’s sloop.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Carney!” he called out.</p>

<p>There was a second of silence, and then Andy
Carney’s face appeared at the entrance to the cuddy.</p>

<p>“What do you want?” he demanded, with an
ugly look on his face.</p>

<p>“We want you,” replied my helper. “Come out
of that at once!”</p>

<p>“I’ll come out when I please,” was the sullen
response.</p>

<p>“No, you won’t; you’ll come out now.”</p>

<p>“Who made you boss over me?” demanded the
fisherman.</p>

<p>“Nobody; but you’ve got to come. Do you see
that?”</p>

<p>And he pointed to the gun, which I held to my
shoulder.</p>

<p>Carney looked at the weapon, and turned pale.</p>

<p>“Put that down!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” I returned. “You have got to
do as Ford says. I give you two minutes in which
to make up your mind.”</p>

<p>“I won’t come.”</p>

<p>“I think you will.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>And I moved over to where I could get a better
range at his head.</p>

<p>He ducked, and then came out slowly, and faced
Ford.</p>

<p>“If you were alone I would soon do you up,” he
hissed.</p>

<p>“But I am not alone,” laughed my helper. “Hold
out your hands.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to bind them.”</p>

<p>“Do as Ford says,” I put in. “We mean business,
Carney.”</p>

<p>The fisherman hesitated for a moment, and then
held out his hands. Ford caught up a bit of rope,
and soon had the wrists crossed and tightly bound.</p>

<p>“Now watch him, Rube, while I shove the boat
out.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do with me?” asked
Carney anxiously.</p>

<p>“Take you to Bend Center.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“You’ll see fast enough.”</p>

<p>In a moment Ford had the sloop afloat; and with
the three of us on board he ran up the mainsail,
steered out of the inlet, and down the lake.</p>

<p>“What have you done with the things you stole?”
I asked, as I sat down to watch our prisoner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>“Didn’t steal anything,” replied Carney sullenly.</p>

<p>“So you expect to deny it?” I went on.</p>

<p>He would not answer, and I did not question him
farther. I wished to examine the cuddy of the sloop,
but could get no chance to do so, for Ford was busy
sailing the craft, and I thought it would not be safe
to leave Carney unwatched even for a moment.</p>

<p>It did not take us long to reach the wharf at the
Point. Here a small crowd soon surrounded us;
for the report of the robbery had made a good many
men suspend work and keep a lookout for the
robbers.</p>

<p>Ford marched Carney up to Squire Slocum’s office.
I lingered behind to make an examination of the cuddy.</p>

<p>It was not long before I found all the articles
that had belonged to the mill stored in the forward
hold. I also found Mr. Norton’s valise; but it had
been broken open, and was empty.</p>

<p>This last discovery filled me with dismay, for I
had counted on the contents of the valise clearing
up part of the mystery surrounding the man who
had treated me so harshly. Whether Carney had
thrown the letters away or hidden them I could not
tell.</p>

<p>As soon as I had finished my investigation, I followed
the others to the squire’s office. I found
Squire Slocum examining Carney, and ready to hear
what I might say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>

<p>“I will lock him up, and we will have a full
hearing to-morrow,” said Squire Slocum after I had
finished. “I am in a hurry this morning. I will
send a message to Pointer, telling him about the
meeting last night at the mill. I wish you had
let me know as soon as possible, but I suppose you
were worn out.”</p>

<p>“Both that, and besides the fire drove it out of
my mind,” I replied.</p>

<p>“And that was the case with me,” added Ford.</p>

<p>“I will also have a man take charge of Carney’s
boat,” went on the squire. “We now have three
different boats with detectives on board sailing the
lake, and perhaps we’ll catch these fellows before
night.”</p>

<p>“Ford and I are going after them too,” I returned.</p>

<p>“Well, every one counts,” said the squire with
a smile.</p>

<p>I could see that he was in a terrible hurry, and
as soon as the fisherman was given in charge of
the jailer we left.</p>

<p>On my way to the wharf I ran against Tom Darrow.
He was glad to see me out.</p>

<p>“And glad to know that Markham proved to be
a gentleman,” he added. “And that reminds me, Gus
Lowell found your mill-boat over to Summer’s Point.
He brought it over to Ray’s dock.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span></p>

<p>This was welcome news, and it would not now be
necessary to borrow a boat in which to go after Mr.
Norton and his two confederates. I ran down to the
place that Tom had mentioned, and was soon at the
wharf in my own boat.</p>

<p>Ford came on board, and we set out on a voyage
of discovery, as he termed it. Darrow would have
liked to accompany us, but said he had work on
hand, having an order for forty pounds of fish for
one of the Bayport hotels.</p>

<p>“And it don’t pay to let such an order slip by,”
he added. “Not when prices are high and biting
is good.”</p>

<p>“Where do you intend to go first?” asked Ford
when we were well on our way.</p>

<p>“I think the fellows made for Rock Island,” I said.</p>

<p>“That’s my idea, though both of us may be mistaken.”</p>

<p>“The island makes a good hiding-place,” I went
on. “But still they can’t stay there forever, and I
take it they would rather leave the neighborhood
entirely.”</p>

<p>“They can’t do that if all the roads are guarded,
and Squire Slocum said such was a fact. They would
have a sweet job trying to get through the woods.”</p>

<p>“It’s a wonder they committed the robbery when
the chances to escape were so slim.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>“I guess they thought to get away before the crime
was discovered. Mr. Webster said it was only by accident
that it was not allowed to run on till noon
or later. The old vault, in which the safe was situated
where the diamonds were placed, is not used
for storing the regular bank-funds, and besides, Mr.
Merton, the cashier, rarely gets to the bank as early
as he did on the morning following the robbery.”</p>

<p>“It was all known beforehand among the three
men,” I went on. “But how did they get their
knowledge?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Camp, one of the jewelers, says he thinks
he knows this Avery, but he is not sure. The description
is all right; but the name of the man he
knew was Denting.”</p>

<p>“A name among such fellows is easily changed.”</p>

<p>“Of course. But then—hullo, whose boat is that?”</p>

<p>Ford pointed to where a large sloop had just passed
beyond a point of land just ahead.</p>

<p>“I didn’t see much of her,” I replied.</p>

<p>“She looked to me like the Catch Me.”</p>

<p>“The Catch Me!”</p>

<p>“Exactly. I might have been mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Who can be on board?”</p>

<p>“We’ll see when we round the point. Hold up.
Now let her go. The wind is getting fresh and no
mistake. There is the boat. What do you think
of her?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>I gave a long and searching look.</p>

<p>“It is the Catch Me beyond a doubt,” I cried.
“Who can it possibly be that is sailing her?”</p>

<p>“There is only one man on board as far as I can
see,” replied Ford.</p>

<p>“It is Mr. Norton!” I ejaculated a moment later.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI.<br>
<small>A STORM ON THE LAKE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The announcement that the person in the other
boat was the very one for whom we and the detectives
were hunting, was so surprising that for a
moment Ford could hardly believe it was a fact.</p>

<p>“You are sure?”</p>

<p>“Exactly. Don’t you remember that curious hat
he wore?”</p>

<p>“I do, now you speak of it. I wonder where he
is bound?”</p>

<p>“We’ll soon find out,” I replied decidedly.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to follow him?”</p>

<p>“Not only follow him, but catch him, Dan.”</p>

<p>“You really mean it, though he is your uncle?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do.”</p>

<p>When I told Ford that I intended to follow Mr.
Norton, and capture him if possible, I meant every
word I said.</p>

<p>The fact that the man posed as my uncle must
have nothing to do with my feelings. He was a
criminal, and must be handed over to the authorities.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>I let out the mainsail, and ran up the jib to its
fullest. This sent us forging ahead, and we began to
close up the distance that separated the two crafts.</p>

<p>“I think we’ll overtake the Catch Me in a quarter
of an hour,” I said, after I had done all I could
to increase our speed.</p>

<p>“We will if this breeze holds out, and he doesn’t
trim the sails,” replied Ford. “He is carrying too
much canvas.”</p>

<p>“I suppose Mr. Norton is not much of a sailor,
or he would run right away from us. The Catch
Me is a far better boat than the Mary.”</p>

<p>“Of course; but his lack of knowledge is to our
benefit.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like the looks of those clouds over there,”
I went on, pointing over to the west. “That is a
regular squall quarter.”</p>

<p>“If we catch anything like that, it will be look
out all around!” laughed my helper.</p>

<p>In five minutes we were within hard hailing-distance
of the other boat; and then Ford called out
through his hands, using them as a speaking-trumpet,—</p>

<p>“Sloop ahoy!”</p>

<p>There was no reply, and he repeated the call.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t intend to answer,” I remarked. “But
see, he is trimming his sails. He intends to get away
if possible. I wonder if he recognizes us?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder. He’s foolish for taking in
sail now, when the wind is dying out,” added Ford.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. We may have more
wind than we want presently.”</p>

<p>And I pointed to a heavy cloud that was scurrying
over.</p>

<p>“By George! I think you are right!” exclaimed
the mill-hand. “That looks nasty, and no mistake!”</p>

<p>A moment later the wind died out utterly. We
almost came to a standstill, and immediately dropped
all sails. The Catch Me did the same, but not before
she had been carried a goodly distance farther away.</p>

<p>“Here it comes!” I shouted, as a long, low line
of white swept up from the south. “Hold fast,
Dan!”</p>

<p>“I’m all right, Rube; look out for yourself.”</p>

<p>He had hardly spoken before the first brush of
the squall was upon us. It caused the water to
foam and dash on all sides, and the Mary bobbed
up and down as if she was a cork.</p>

<p>Then came a heavy puff of wind that sent us
driving onward, and made us ship fully half a dozen
pails of water. I began to bail out; and seeing this,
Ford set to helping me.</p>

<p>A moment later the sky was fairly black, and it
began to rain, first lightly, but soon in a perfect torrent.
We had but scant protection, and it did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
take long for the water to get to our very skins,
making us far from comfortable.</p>

<p>“Do you see anything of the Catch Me?” I shouted,
so as to be heard above the roaring of the wind.</p>

<p>“No; the rain hides everything,” replied Ford.
“Wonder how long this squall is going to last?”</p>

<p>“They never last very long; but we must keep
on bailing, or we will be swamped.”</p>

<p>After this we were silent for perhaps ten minutes.
I could not help but shiver, and I saw that my companion
did the same.</p>

<p>“I think it is letting up on the blow,” said Ford
presently.</p>

<p>“It is; but it’s raining as hard as ever.”</p>

<p>Five minutes later the shower stopped short, and
the clouds began to scatter.</p>

<p>“The squall is over. They are always short, sharp,
and nasty. Let us hoist the mainsail, and continue
our chase.”</p>

<p>Easier said than done. Under cover of the squall
the Catch Me had slid out of sight.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll make for Rock Island. I am satisfied
that that is the place for which Mr. Norton was bound.
It is more than likely he has been off to get some
provisions.”</p>

<p>“Shouldn’t wonder but what you were right, Rube.
Shall we make for the south shore?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>“That is as good as any. We can watch out for
the Catch Me, and by getting her away leave the
robbers without a means of quitting the place.”</p>

<p>“True! I never thought of that. The south shore
it is.”</p>

<p>Presently the setting sun came out, and we made
arrangements to dry our clothing. Luckily there
were a couple of old suits in the cuddy of the sloop,
and these were put on in the meanwhile.</p>

<p>In half an hour we were in sight of the island,
and then we took a reef in the mainsail, and lowered
the jib.</p>

<p>“We want to be as careful as possible,” I said.
“These men are desperate, and they may be on the
watch for any one who comes along.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got the gun.”</p>

<p>“I know that; but it isn’t much to depend on in
a tight corner.”</p>

<p>In a moment we were within a hundred feet of the
rocky shore. Nothing was to be seen of a boat of
any kind.</p>

<p>“It is evident that Mr. Norton didn’t land here,”
I said, “unless he pulled his boat ’way up in the
bushes; and that I don’t believe, for the Catch Me is
a heavy craft to handle.”</p>

<p>“Shall we go around to the east or west?” asked
my companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>“Suppose we go to the west. It really doesn’t
matter much.”</p>

<p>So we set our course for the west coast of Rock
Island. We had hardly gone half a dozen rods before
Ford caught me by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“We made a lucky choice!” he cried. “There
is the spot where the man we are after landed!”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” I questioned eagerly.</p>

<p>“Because there is the Catch Me in the bushes
beyond.”</p>

<p>“Has he left her, do you think?” I asked in considerable
excitement.</p>

<p>“I think so. I will go ahead and see. Hold your
gun in case he intends to surprise us.”</p>

<p>I did so; and Ford went forward and landed on
the rocks. He was gone fully five minutes.</p>

<p>“No one around,” he said, upon his return.</p>

<p>“Maybe Mr. Norton has gone off to warn the
others,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he has. Any way I didn’t see a soul.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better get the Catch Me out into the
lake? Then we can land and hide the Mary in
another place.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good plan,” said Ford. “Come ahead.”</p>

<p>It was no easy job to get out the larger boat. But
finally it was accomplished, and the big craft was
anchored fully quarter of a mile away from the shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span></p>

<p>“Now, if they haven’t another boat, they are prisoners,”
I said. “That is, if we can hide the Mary
where they can’t find her.”</p>

<p>“I know a spot, a little farther up the shore,”
said my companion. “Let us try that.”</p>

<p>We hoisted the sail once more and stood up the
shore fully an eighth of a mile. Then Ford took
the tiller, and headed the craft for a deep and narrow
inlet, guarded on both sides by high rocks and
heavy bushes.</p>

<p>“Now, if they haven’t seen us, I guess they will
never find the Mary.”</p>

<p>“I think I’d have a job finding her myself,” I
laughed. “It’s so dark I can hardly see a thing!”</p>

<p>We lowered the sails and pushed the Mary as deep
into the bushes as possible. Then we jumped ashore,
tied fast, and hurried back to the spot where the
Catch Me had been beached.</p>

<p>“There ought to be some tracks in the mud,” I
said. “See how soft the rain has made the soil.”</p>

<p>“It would be easy enough to follow the man if it
wasn’t for the rocks,” returned Ford. “But we will
do what we can, and that, too, without waste of time.
It will be a feather in our cap if we capture the
whole crowd.”</p>

<p>“Here are footprints,” I went on. “Do you see,
they lead from this place where the Catch Me struck
over those rocks to the north?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>“That’s so. Let us see if we can catch them again
beyond the rocks. Come, don’t make any more noise
than you can help.”</p>

<p>We walked on with our heads bent close to the
ground. When we reached the spot where the rocks
ended and the marshland began, we could for the
moment distinguish nothing.</p>

<p>“It’s lost,” said Ford soberly.</p>

<p>“No; here it is,” I whispered, “and quite fresh,
if I am not mistaken.”</p>

<p>“An hour more and we’ll be lost in the dark. It
must be every bit of five o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and later. We lost a good deal of time
down at the Bend.”</p>

<p>After this we followed the footprints in silence.</p>

<p>They took a roundabout course over the marshes,
for which Rock Island was noted, and then gradually
struck a direct path leading to the north.</p>

<p>I was ahead, and carried the gun in such a fashion
that it could be brought into instant use.</p>

<p>“Go slower,” cautioned Ford; “they can’t be far
away.”</p>

<p>I slowed up, and listened intently. Some distance
ahead I fancied I heard the murmur of voices.</p>

<p>I nodded to Ford, and he came up close.</p>

<p>“They are just ahead,” I whispered into his ear.
“I wonder if there isn’t some sort of a hut beyond?”</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>With my heart beating loudly I continued to advance,
my companion close behind me. Presently
we came to a number of big rocks, the ones, in fact,
from which the island derives its name. Here we
halted and listened once more.</p>

<p>“You say some one followed you?” we heard the
voice of Avery say.</p>

<p>“Yes; two men,” was Mr. Norton’s reply. “I
couldn’t make them out. They must be close to the
island by this time.”</p>

<p>“Then we must divide the booty, and get out as
fast as possible,” said another; and I knew it was
the man called Yates. “Put all the stones together,
boys, here on this board, and we’ll draw lots for them,
after dividing them into three parts.”</p>

<p><a href="#i_fp182">Then I crawled up the rocks and peered over.</a></p>

<p>Beyond was a rude shelter of boards, and sitting
beneath it were the trio of robbers, with the stolen
diamonds spread out before them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.<br>
<small>AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The sight of the three men with the stolen diamonds
spread out between them was an interesting
one to Ford and myself. The trio had a lantern,
and in the rays of this the precious stones sparkled
radiantly.</p>

<p>“If we could only dash in and scoop the pile,”
whispered my companion.</p>

<p>“We want to scoop the men as well,” I whispered
in return. “It won’t do to let them escape now we
have found out their hiding-place.”</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, and then Mr. Norton
continued,—</p>

<p>“We’ve had a harder time getting this stuff than
we anticipated, boys. If I had known what a job
it would be I would never have agreed to the plan
when it came up.”</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t have been so hard if you had listened
to my way,” put in Yates. “I can’t see why you
wanted to drag in that boy over at the mill.”</p>

<p>“That’s because you are not up to all the tricks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
of the trade,” laughed Norton. “If he had been anyway
pliable we would all have escaped without half
trying, and perhaps with more booty.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I understand it’s a big thing to stand in
with some one in the neighborhood,” remarked Avery.
“It helped me considerable in Baltimore. But this
plan was so roundabout.”</p>

<p>“That was because things happened as they did,”
replied Mr. Norton. “If I hadn’t fallen in with
Stone out West everything would have been different.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve got the stones, and now the thing
is to get out of the neighborhood as quickly as possible,”
said Avery. “You are known, and I suppose
we will be soon.”</p>

<p>“Yes.” Mr. Norton paused. “Come, let us examine
the diamonds, and divide them as evenly as possible.”</p>

<p>“All right. There are just fifteen of them, not
counting the one that was lost in the mill when you
drugged the boy,” said Yates. “Who is to lose that?”</p>

<p>“I drugged the boy for the good of the party,”
explained Mr. Norton; “it was better and handier than
tying him. I am sure he doesn’t know a thing of
what happened that night.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that,” I muttered.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile the diamonds were carefully
examined, and after many comments divided into
three little heaps. Then Mr. Norton got out some
strips of paper, and they drew lots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>I motioned for Ford to follow me to a spot some
distance away.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” he asked, as soon as we
were out of hearing.</p>

<p>“They are getting ready to leave,” I said. “One
of us ought to let the police know. It is impossible
for us to capture the three of them.”</p>

<p>“One of us ought to stay here,” said my companion.</p>

<p>“Suppose I do that?” I suggested. “You can take
the Mary and run over to Bayport, and return as
quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>“But if they leave in the meanwhile?”</p>

<p>“Then I will follow them, and leave directions on
a slip of paper pinned to this tree, so that you can
follow.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea. But aren’t you afraid to
stay alone?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Don’t let them discover you. Remember, a boy
can’t stand much show against three men.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be careful, Dan. Of course you know enough
to come back as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>“Trust me for that, even if I have to come alone.
I won’t be gone more than an hour and a half.”</p>

<p>“All right. Now you had better start without
delay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>A moment later Ford was gone. For an instant
my heart sank as I realized that I was alone. Then
I pulled myself together, and resolved that come
what might I would do all in my power to capture
the three lawless men.</p>

<p>I tiptoed my way back to the spot where the trio
were sitting, discussing the best plan for leaving Rock
Island.</p>

<p>“It will be risky business to use the Catch Me,”
observed Mr. Norton. “Somebody might be on the
lookout for that craft, and the moment we were
spotted that would be the end of the whole matter.”</p>

<p>“One thing is certain,” put in Yates, “we must
leave before daylight if possible. To remain longer,
when all the police are on our track, is foolish. The
question is, are we going together, or are we going
to separate?”</p>

<p>“I move we separate,” said Avery. “It will lessen
the chances of capture. We can come together in
Philadelphia.”</p>

<p>“It’s no fool of a job getting away in this darkness,”
remarked Yates. “It’s as dark as pitch, and
I don’t know a thing about the island or the lake
shore.”</p>

<p>“You are no worse off than I,” replied Avery.
“I’ve only been around for a few days, and those
were spent principally about Bayport.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span></p>

<p>“Let us go down to the shore, and see how the
land lays,” suggested Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and a moment later the three
rose and made a move for the spot where the Catch
Me had landed.</p>

<p>When they were out of sight I hastily struck a
match and scrawled these words on a bit of paper:—</p>

<p>“Gone to shore where the Catch Me was beached.”</p>

<p>This brief message I pinned fast to the bark of
a tree and then followed the men.</p>

<p>As I moved along my thoughts were busy, thinking
over what I had heard. It was a surprise to me to
learn that the robbery had been so perfectly planned,
and that I had been dragged into it because to do
so was a trick “of the trade,” whatever that might
mean.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton and his actions were a perfect mystery
to me. He had taken such pains to establish himself
as my guardian, and now he seemed willing to let the
whole matter drop. Of course he had not expected
to be discovered as one of the robbers of the bank,
but for all that I—well, I simply couldn’t understand
the man.</p>

<p>The men moved along swiftly, and in order to keep
them in sight, I had to approach quite close to them.
In doing this I was injudicious, and when they suddenly
halted, I nearly ran over them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>I checked myself as quickly as possible, but not
before I had made considerable noise, which reached
the ears of the entire party at once.</p>

<p>“What was that?” exclaimed Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>“Somebody following us!” cried Avery. “Hullo,
there! who are you?” he called out, as he made a
dash back.</p>

<p>I made no reply, but continued to retreat. In a
moment the whole party were in pursuit.</p>

<p>“We must catch him, whoever he is,” cried Mr.
Norton. “I shouldn’t wonder if it is one of the
fellows that followed me in the boat.”</p>

<p>“Why not leave him go and skip ourselves?”
asked Yates, halting.</p>

<p>“No, no,” put in Avery. “If he is alone he will
put others on our track. He has overheard all we
have said. Catch him!”</p>

<p>And they made after me with renewed vigor.</p>

<p>But I was nimble of foot, and was soon a fair distance
away. In front of me I saw a large cedar-tree,
and it did not take me long to climb into this and
secrete myself among the branches.</p>

<p>As I did so, the party burst into the vacant space
below.</p>

<p>“Phew! but he can run, whoever he is,” exclaimed
Avery, puffing.</p>

<p>“Listen!” cried Mr. Norton; and they all did so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>I kept an absolute silence, and nothing but the
croaking of frogs and the lonely hooting of an owl
broke the stillness.</p>

<p>“It’s no use,” he went on. “The fellow, whoever
he is, has got away, and it’s worse than hunting for
a pin in a haystack to try to find him.”</p>

<p>The other two were silent, and by looking down
I saw Avery scratch his forehead.</p>

<p>“It’s funny that he could have got away so quickly,”
he said. “We were right on his heels.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it was Reuben,” said Mr. Norton suddenly.
“I take it that he is mighty nimble on his feet.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but I supposed he was in jail.”</p>

<p>“Might have got out on bail. I’ve found out that
they think a sight of the young miller in Bend Center.”</p>

<p>“A good deal more than they do of his uncle,
eh?” chuckled Yates.</p>

<p>And then he and Avery broke out into a coarse
laugh, in which Mr. Norton was forced to join.</p>

<p>“Let us forget that,” said the latter finally. “It’s
a good joke on me, I suppose; but we’ve got serious
business ahead. Come, we will make for the shore
again.”</p>

<p>And he turned to do so. While they still hesitated,
Avery flashed the rays of the lantern about;
and to take advantage of the light thus afforded to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
get a good look at the two strangers, I leaned far
down.</p>

<p>In doing this I forgot to hold my cap, and presently
it left my head, and before I could stop it, it went
sailing straight to Mr. Norton’s feet.</p>

<p>“What’s this?” he cried, starting back.</p>

<p>Then he picked up the cap and examined it.</p>

<p>“Reuben Stone’s cap!” he ejaculated. “I’ll wager
a thousand dollars he’s up that tree!”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIII">CHAPTER XXIII.<br>
<small>CAPTURED.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Mr. Norton’s words made my heart leap into my
throat. I dodged out of sight, but I felt it in my
bones that I was about to be discovered.</p>

<p>“Reuben Stone’s cap,” repeated Yates. “Are you
sure?”</p>

<p>“I certainly am.”</p>

<p>“Then the boy must be up the tree,” put in Avery.
“Hi, there! Come down out of that!” he called.</p>

<p>Of course I paid no attention to this command.</p>

<p>“Yes, Reuben, come down,” added Mr. Norton.
“It will do no good to try to hide.”</p>

<p>I remained silent, and for a moment the trio did
the same.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to go up after him,” I heard one of
them say in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he’s got a gun,” put in another.</p>

<p>“He wouldn’t dare to fire it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. He’s a boy with lots
of backbone.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile I was calculating the chances of escape.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
It was dark on all sides, and that, I felt certain, would
aid me greatly.</p>

<p>Near the tree up which I was hiding was another
tree much larger. Without making any noise I swung
from one to the other, and got out on a limb that
extended fully twenty feet away from the spot where
the three men stood.</p>

<p>“I’ll go up the tree,” I heard Mr. Norton say.</p>

<p>“Reuben, you might as well come down,” he
shouted.</p>

<p>I kept silent; and getting Avery to aid him with
the lantern, Mr. Norton began the ascent.</p>

<p>I allowed him to get well into the branches before
making any movement of my own.</p>

<p>“Got him?” called Yates.</p>

<p>“Not yet. Reuben!”</p>

<p>At that instant I allowed myself to drop to the
ground. I landed in a soft spot without making any
noise. In an instant I made off at the top of my
speed.</p>

<p>I would have escaped but for one thing. Just as
I started to run, Avery flashed the lantern full upon
me. It was a purely accidental movement, but it
revealed me to both him and Yates.</p>

<p>“There is the boy now!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Where?” cried Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>“Down here! Stop! stop!” he yelled, and dashed
after me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span></p>

<p>Yates followed, and so did my guardian as soon
as he could descend. I had a fair start, and was
just congratulating myself upon getting away, when
I ran up against one of the rocky mounds scattered
all over the island.</p>

<p>I looked around to the right and to the left for
a way to escape, but discovered none. Then I attempted
to scale the rocks, but had hardly got halfway
to the top when Avery caught me by the foot.</p>

<p>“Let go!” I cried.</p>

<p>“Not much I won’t!” he responded. “Come
down here.”</p>

<p>I tried to kick him, and did so, though not very
hard. Then he gave a strong pull, and I came down
in a heap.</p>

<p>“You can’t come it over me,” he cried.</p>

<p>He had landed directly on top of me; but I began
to squirm at a lively rate, and he soon saw that he
would not be able to hold me.</p>

<p>“Lie still, or I’ll give you a crack on the head!”</p>

<p>“I won’t be still,” I returned. “Let me up!”</p>

<p>“Quiet, I tell you. Hurry up!” he called to the
others.</p>

<p>“We’re coming,” they cried.</p>

<p>“Have you got him?” added Mr. Norton anxiously.</p>

<p>“Yes; but he’s three handsful to handle.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be there in a second.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

<p>By this time I had squirmed to one side, and
managed by hard work to partly raise myself.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Avery gave me a stinging blow on
the side of the head.</p>

<p>The crack made me see stars, and I fell back.
But I did not lose my presence of mind, and I returned
the blow with interest.</p>

<p>It seemed to surprise the fellow, for he burst into
a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, you are a plucky chap, and no mistake!”
he exclaimed. “However, all this struggling of
yours won’t do you any good. I’ve handled too
many men to be outdone by a boy.”</p>

<p>I wrenched myself loose, and sprang to my feet.
He was after me, and in a trice I was again on my
back.</p>

<p>In falling my head struck a rock. The bump
stunned me for the instant, and it raised a big lump
besides. I essayed to get away again; but my head
was in a whirl, and finally I was forced to abandon
the struggle.</p>

<p>“Now we’ve got you,” he panted.</p>

<p>I made no reply, and presently Yates and Mr.
Norton came up.</p>

<p>“Ha, Reuben, you rascal, you thought you would
be smart, did you?” said Mr. Norton, as he grasped
me by the shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>“What do you intend to do with me?” I asked,
as coolly as I could, though I was both excited and
out of breath.</p>

<p>“You’ve been spying on us, haven’t you?” said
Yates.</p>

<p>To this I made no reply.</p>

<p>“How long have you been on the island?” questioned
my guardian.</p>

<p>“I shall not tell you,” I replied firmly.</p>

<p>“I say you will!” he ejaculated, getting angry at
once.</p>

<p>I remained silent.</p>

<p>“Are you going to tell me?”</p>

<p>I wiped the perspiration from my brow and adjusted
my clothes.</p>

<p>“Do you hear me, Reuben?” he stormed.</p>

<p>“Please give me my cap,” I said to Yates; and
he handed it over.</p>

<p>“If the boy is going to act like a mule, what is
the use of wasting time over him,” put in Avery.
“The question is, now we’ve got him, what are we
going to do with him?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to put him out of existence!” growled
Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>“We can’t do that,” said Yates. “Shall we take
him along?”</p>

<p>There was considerable talk, and then this was
agreed to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<p>“Now, then, forward march!” cried Mr. Norton.
“And mind you don’t dare to escape or I won’t be
responsible for whatever happens to you.”</p>

<p>“I won’t go along,” I said stubbornly.</p>

<p>“You won’t?”</p>

<p>“Not a step. You have no right to act in this
manner. I have as much right to come on this island
as you have without being molested.”</p>

<p>“Getting on your high horse!” sneered Mr.
Norton.</p>

<p>“If so, I intend to stay there,” was my quick
reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton tried to force me forward; but I refused
to budge, and finally sat down on a rock.</p>

<p>“Now what are you going to do?” asked Avery,
who I really believe was inclined to laugh at the
whole scene. “Rather rough when an uncle can’t
manage his own nephew.”</p>

<p>And both he and Yates let off a loud laugh.</p>

<p>“It’s no laughing matter,” growled Mr. Norton.
“This boy knows altogether too much. If we got
caught, he could place us in a fine box.”</p>

<p>“Well, as he won’t go along, suppose we leave
him here,” said Yates.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Let us tie him up to one of the trees. Before
he can manage to get away, we’ll be out of the district.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span></p>

<p>“But he may not be able to get away at all if
we bind him too fast,” suggested Avery. “Then he
would starve to death.”</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t harm much,” said Mr. Norton.
“It’s a good idea,” he went on. “Any rope in the
crowd?”</p>

<p>There was; and it was quickly brought forward.</p>

<p>Things were getting to look serious. To be left
behind bound to a tree was far from pleasant to contemplate.
I half wished I had agreed to accompany
the three men.</p>

<p>“I won’t be bound!” I cried. And jumping up,
I tried to dash away. But my guardian was too
quick for me. He caught me by the arm and held
me with all his strength.</p>

<p>“Here is a tree, boys,” he said. “I will hold him
while you put the rope around him. Mind you get
it tight or he’ll be out of it in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>“Not when I tie the knots,” said Yates. “You
forget I spent six years at sea and understand how
to handle a rope perfectly.”</p>

<p>The rope was a long one, and it was passed
around my body and the tree several times. Then
my feet were fastened, and finally my hands.</p>

<p>“Now he’s as stiff as a poker,” went on Yates.
“I’ll warrant he won’t get loose short of four or
five hours at the least.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span></p>

<p>“It ought to be four or five days,” grumbled
Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>“Seems to me you’re pretty hard on the boy,” remarked
Avery. “For an uncle, it doesn’t look well
at all.”</p>

<p>“Mind your own business!” cried my guardian.</p>

<p>“This is my business. We’ve done enough in
stealing the diamonds without leaving the boy to die
here.”</p>

<p>“He’s all right,” was the reply. “Come on. We
have lost too much time already.”</p>

<p>And the three men hurried off, leaving me to my
fate.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXIV">CHAPTER XXIV.<br>
<small>IN THE WOODS.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>For several minutes I heard the footsteps of the
trio as they made their way towards the shore; then
all became silent, and I realized that I was alone.</p>

<p>It was intensely dark, the heavy branches overhead
completely shutting out every bit of light
that the night might have otherwise afforded.</p>

<p>I do not claim to be over brave, and the darkness
and the loneliness of my position sent a shiver
through my frame. How long must I remain in
that dismal spot?</p>

<p>I tried to move my hands and my feet, but all
appeared to be as fast as if bound with iron.
Yates had done his work well, and I was, beyond
a doubt, a close prisoner.</p>

<p>After a struggle that lasted for a quarter of an
hour or more, and nearly wore the skin from my
wrists, I ceased, and gave myself up to bitter reflection.</p>

<p>I wondered if Ford was on his way back to the
island, and if he had the police with him. It was
hardly possible, yet I trusted that such was the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>Then I thought of what the three men might say
when they found the Catch Me gone. Would they
have any other means of leaving Rock Island? I
fervently hoped not.</p>

<p>Presently, as much to keep my courage up as anything
else, I began to yell at the top of my voice.
There was no reply; and finally I was compelled to
cease out of pure weariness.</p>

<p>After the lantern had disappeared from my sight,
the darkness was at first intense, and I could not see
the thicket that I knew was but ten feet ahead of me.</p>

<p>But as my eyes grew more accustomed to the place,
I gradually found that by straining my sight I could
see a short distance to the front. I was so tightly
bound, that to view the situation in any other direction
was utterly impossible.</p>

<p>The tree to which I was fastened was a tall and
stately elm. It was fully a foot and a half in diameter,
and as firm as the rocks that surrounded it.</p>

<p>As I have said, a thicket was directly ahead;
what was behind me I did not know, saving the
rocks that I had endeavored to scale.</p>

<p>I realized that I was in a bad fix indeed. How
long would I have to remain in this position? Would
the morning bring a change, or would I be compelled
to remain tied to the tree until hunger and thirst
had done their work and life had gone out of me?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>What a base and cruel man Mr. Norton had proved
himself to be! Undoubtedly he was one of the three
robbers; and I could not help but shudder at the
thought that he was my uncle.</p>

<p>The trio had now divided the diamonds and were
ready to separate. If they could find a means of
leaving the island, they would do so in short order;
and once on the mainland it would be no easy matter
to follow them. There were numerous roads, and
the Bayport and Bend Center police were not of the
best.</p>

<p>But for the present, what was to be done?</p>

<p>Ten minutes went by. To me it seemed a perfect
age.</p>

<p>Suddenly the crackling of some dead leaves broke
upon my ear. Was some one approaching?</p>

<p>I listened intently. The sound came nearer; and
far behind it I heard another sound, as of the footsteps
of a man.</p>

<p>Wondering what it could mean, I stretched my
neck and peered towards the spot.</p>

<p>The next instant I gave a cry of horror.</p>

<p>Two shining eyes glared at me through an opening,
and I heard the low growl of some wild animal.</p>

<p>Words cannot express my feelings at this moment.
My very heart seemed to stop beating. I tried to
cry out, but found I could not make a sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>At the edge of the opening the animal paused, as
if to take in the situation. Then it moved to a point
somewhere behind me.</p>

<p>What was it? A fox, a wolf, or some larger animal?
The very thought of its presence gave me a thrill
of horror.</p>

<p>For one moment all was silent. I saw or heard
nothing of the animal. Had it left the neighborhood?
Oh, how I prayed that this might be so!</p>

<p>Then I heard the noise again, off to the right.
At first it was faint, as if going from me; but then
it became louder, and I knew that the animal was
approaching once more.</p>

<p>How I wished that I was free and that I had my
gun! But I was helpless, and must take whatever
came.</p>

<p>A moment dragged by slowly. My nerves were
strung to the highest tension. I strained my eyes,
but could see nothing.</p>

<p>Suddenly I caught sight of the eyes again. To
me they seemed like twin stars, and my hair fairly
stood on end as I beheld them.</p>

<p>Then came a growl, low at first, and then louder.
It was the unmistakable mutterings of a wolf!</p>

<p>I knew that Rock Island was infested by that
species of wild animal. Some years before my father
and I had killed three of the beasts on the south
shore during the winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>I tugged at the rope that bound me with might
and main. Soon my right wrist was so chafed that
it began to bleed.</p>

<p>I was afraid the scent of blood would attract the
wolf’s attention, and in this I was not mistaken;
for presently he stopped growling and took a deep
breath.</p>

<p>But my tuggings at the rope were not without
result; for presently I managed to squeeze my left
hand through the tight opening. It hurt to do so,
but in the excitement of the moment this was not
noticed.</p>

<p>My left hand free, I tried with all my power to
make my right hand follow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the wolf, scenting the blood, stopped
growling, and broke into a short bark, not unlike
that of a terrified dog. This struck straight to my
heart, for I knew that he was now getting ready
to attack me.</p>

<p>My right wrist was so lacerated by the rough rope
that I found it impossible to withdraw it. In trying
to do so I merely made the blood flow more
freely, and this soon reached the wolf’s nose and
made him more savage than ever.</p>

<p>He disappeared for a moment again, and I could
hear nothing of him. But I was certain he would
not remain away for any great length of time. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
he had companions in the vicinity, and had
gone to call them to the spot.</p>

<p>A moment later his lonely howl arose on the night
air calling to his mates. I listened with strained
ears, but heard no response.</p>

<p>With my left hand, I now set to work to untie
the rope which Yates had fastened so well. In my
nervous haste I broke off all my finger-nails before
I had the first knot started.</p>

<p>But finally the knot was undone, and then I began
on the second. Had I been less excited I might
have worked faster, but as it was, all my fingers appeared
to be thumbs.</p>

<p>The second knot was untied, and I was just congratulating
myself on getting my hands free, when
the wolf burst through the thicket directly ahead.</p>

<p>I saw at a glance that he was ready to attack
me. His eyes were glaring, and his teeth fairly glistened
in the darkness.</p>

<p>It was then that my voice came back to me, and
I uttered one wild, unearthly scream for help.</p>

<p>The next instant the savage beast hurled itself
at me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.<br>
<small>A MIRACULOUS ESCAPE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I now found myself face to face with one of the
most dangerous positions into which it had ever been
my misfortune to stumble. The wolf that had attacked
me was both large and fierce, and unless by
some means I became able to combat its onslaught,
I felt that my life might end then and there.</p>

<p>My terrible scream made the animal draw back
for an instant, and during this brief space of time
I managed through sheer desperation to free my
right hand.</p>

<p>While doing this, I remember that close to the
spot where I was a prisoner, I had noticed several
smaller rocks lying at the base of the elm. I bent
down, and by reaching around, managed to secure
one of these, and balanced it over my head.</p>

<p>I had hardly done so before the wolf gathered
himself together, and made another leap, this time
directly for my throat.</p>

<p>With all my strength I hurled the rock. By pure
chance my aim was true, and the missile struck the
brute squarely in the face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span></p>

<p>He uttered a sharp cry of pain and tumbled back.
As he did so, I stooped down and picked up another,
but much smaller stone.</p>

<p>It took him fully a minute to recover from the
blow I had given him, and when he approached
again, he did so with great caution.</p>

<p>But this time I did not give him the chance to
make the leap. It was no pleasant thought to have
him so close to my throat. I took careful aim at
him while he was crouching, and let fly with all the
strength at my command.</p>

<p>The stone struck him directly in the right eye,
and its force was so great that it must have ruined
that optic. He uttered a terrible howl, and turning,
slunk out of sight.</p>

<p>I listened intently, and heard him trot off for a
short distance, and then stop. I knew his nature
was not one to give up what he had once undertaken,
and that as soon as he had recovered partly
from the pain I had inflicted, he would make another
attempt on my life.</p>

<p>I bent down, searching for another stone, but
found none within reach. There was a good one
that I could just touch with the tips of my fingers,
but that was all.</p>

<p>My hands and lips were bleeding, but utterly unmindful
of this, I began work on the rope that still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
bound my body and feet. I believe that I worked
quickly, but to me, at the time, a second seemed an
age.</p>

<p>At length I had myself all liberated but my left
foot, and was just freeing this when the wolf again
appeared. He hardly made a sound, but being on
the alert, I felt his presence long before he got
ready to make his final attack.</p>

<p>I could not understand why the wolf had been so
ferocious at this time of the year. It was midsummer,
and there must have been plenty of small game
on the island upon which he could feed. Perhaps
it was only the smell of human blood that incited
him to charge upon me.</p>

<p>Hardly realizing what I was doing, I picked up
the rope and whirled it at him. The latter turned
and twisted upon the ground like a snake, and as
its end reached the wolf, he sprang back several feet.</p>

<p>Seeing this, I threw the rope at him again, just
as he was ready to spring forward.</p>

<p>This time the coil twisted about one of his forelegs,
and by pulling upon it, I tangled him up in
such a fashion that he tumbled on his back.</p>

<p>At this the beast gave such a cry as I had never
heard before. It was one of wonder and fear combined,
and it was accompanied by a sudden drawing
away and vicious snap at the rope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>He did not, however, hold the rope in his mouth long.
In an instant he had disengaged himself from the
snarl, and this done he broke for cover, and disappeared
from sight forever.</p>

<p>It was an odd way to escape, and I considered myself
very lucky that fortune had favored me.</p>

<p>But then I did not know but what the wolf intended
to return, and so I lost no time in untying
the remainder of the rope that was around me.</p>

<p>At the end of five minutes’ hard work, I found
myself free. The blood flowed from both of my
hands, which were rapidly getting stiff.</p>

<p>The first thing I did was to hunt up a stout club
with which to defend myself from future attacks should
any come.</p>

<p>This done, I stopped at a spring and bathed my
wounds in the cool water. One of my wrists I tied
up in my handkerchief, and the other in some lining
torn from the old coat I wore.</p>

<p>I had hardly finished this operation when I heard
footsteps approaching from the direction of the shore.
At first I had an impression that the wolf was returning,
but soon recognized the sounds as those proceeding
from a human being.</p>

<p>Instinctively I hurried out of sight, dragging the
rope behind me. I had hardly done so when I heard
a yelp, a cry of alarm, and a pistol-shot in quick
succession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>“There! I reckon you’re done for!” I heard a
voice exclaim. “That makes one wolf less on this
island. By thunder! I wonder if any of the critters
have attacked that boy?”</p>

<p>I thought the voice was that of Avery, and I was
not mistaken. I saw the flash of a lantern a moment
later, and the man stepped into the clearing.</p>

<p>“Reuben Stone!” he called.</p>

<p>I made no answer, and he gazed carefully about
on all sides.</p>

<p>“This looks like the spot,” muttered Avery. “Yet
if he ain’t here I must have made a mistake, for he
couldn’t have got away.”</p>

<p>He continued to hunt around until he reached
the base of the rocks where I had been captured.</p>

<p>“No, this is the right place,” he went on. “Here
is the very spot we had the tussle.”</p>

<p>“Reuben Stone!” he called out. “If you don’t
want to starve to death in these woods you had
better answer.”</p>

<p>He listened a moment and then repeated his cry.</p>

<p>I could not help but wonder what had brought
him back, but I was not kept long in suspense.</p>

<p>“That boy must know what has become of the
boat,” he went on to himself. “He seems to be the
only one around.”</p>

<p>He paused for a moment more and looked up into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
the trees. During this time, I fairly held my breath
so fearful was I of discovery.</p>

<p>At length he passed on, satisfied, I think, that
he had made some mistake. I followed, taking good
care on this occasion that I should keep a respectable
distance in the rear and not make any noise.</p>

<p>Avery passed around the spot, and finally came
back to it. He seemed both perplexed and chagrined
at believing that he had made some mistake.
I watched him closely, anxious to know what would
be the man’s next move.</p>

<p>At last he gave up the search; and with a final
call to me to answer, or he would leave me to the
fate mentioned before, he set out for the shore.</p>

<p>It did not take a great while to reach the spot
where he had left his two companions. They were
seated on some rocks, and sprang up as he approached.</p>

<p>“Well, what did the boy say?” demanded Yates.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t find him!” grumbled Avery sullenly.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t find Reuben!” ejaculated Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>“No. He has got away.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” exclaimed Yates. “I tied”—</p>

<p>“You are always bragging about what you can do,”
sneered my guardian. “Now the boy is gone and
the deuce is to pay.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t you see anything of him?” went on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
Yates, who was unwilling to believe what he had
heard.</p>

<p>“No. He either got away, or else the wolves have
made way with him.”</p>

<p>This reply brought forth more questions, and
Avery had to tell his story.</p>

<p>It appeared to disconcert the trio not a little.</p>

<p>“Well, if the boy is gone and the boat too, I
don’t see what we are going to do about it,” said
Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>“The neighborhood is getting too hot for us,”
added Avery. “I move we build a raft rather than
stay here to be captured.”</p>

<p>“Easier said than done,” said Yates. “Building
a raft is all well enough in a story-book, but that
is as far as it goes. That boy must have a boat
somewhere. I move we separate and hunt her up.”</p>

<p>This was finally agreed to, and the party of
three broke up. Mr. Norton started around the
west shore, and I followed him.</p>

<p>Upon the water it was quite bright, and I had
no doubt but that sooner or later one of the party
would see the Catch Me and notify the others. My
one hope was that Ford might return before the discovery
occurred. If he did not, how was the band
of robbers to be traced afterwards?</p>

<p>Suddenly an idea struck me, and I upbraided myself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
for not having thought of it before. It was to
wade out to my craft, board her, and sail out and
stand guard around the island until the arrival of
the police.</p>

<p>I resolved to act upon the inspiration at once.
Pulling off my shoes and stockings, I fastened them
securely around my neck, and made for the shallow
offing where the Catch Me lay.</p>

<p>“Hullo! there’s a boat!” I heard Mr. Norton
suddenly cry.</p>

<p>I made a rush for the craft. In an instant he
discovered me, and a moment later struck me a
blow on the head that laid me senseless on the
rocks.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.<br>
<small>THE CHASE.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I came to my senses with a start. The cooling
waters were dashing over my right arm. A wave
broke over my face, and I sat up in a dazed fashion.</p>

<p>I was on a rock some distance from Rock
Island. How I had come to the spot I did not
know, nor did I at that moment give the matter
a thought. There was a strange ringing in my
ears and an ache in my head.</p>

<p>Slowly I arose and gazed about me. It was early
dawn, and I judged it was four o’clock, or a little
after.</p>

<p>My first thought was of the man who had deprived
me of my senses. I looked towards the island, and
then over the expanse of the lake, but Mr. Norton
was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>The Catch Me, too, had disappeared, and I at once
concluded that the three men had taken the craft and
made for the mainland.</p>

<p>I upbraided myself for having allowed my guardian
to discover me and treat me as he had. Through this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
the trio had escaped, and there was no telling where
they had gone to.</p>

<p>The distance to the island was fully a hundred feet.
During the time I had been lying upon the rocks the
lake had been growing rougher, and it was with great
difficulty that I made my way to the shore, and even
then the wading covered me pretty well with water.</p>

<p>Once on the island again, I sat down on a fallen
tree to review the situation. Both the boat and the
robbers were gone. What was to be done next?</p>

<p>I wondered if Ford had got back from Bayport or
the Bend, and I was just on the point of going on a
tour to find out, when there was a noise behind me,
and the mill-hand appeared.</p>

<p>“So I have found you at last!” he exclaimed, as
he rushed up. “Where have you been? and what has
become of the men?”</p>

<p>“The men have gone, and I don’t know where,” I
replied. “It’s a long story. Did you bring any one
with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes; here is Pointer, and Captain Harley from
Bayport.”</p>

<p>“I’ve found him!” he called.</p>

<p>And the next instant the Bend constable and the
Bayport captain of police appeared upon the scene.</p>

<p>I told my story in all its details. It was listened
to with close attention, and all joined in asking me
a great number of questions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>“We have lost much time in hunting you up,”
said Pointer. “Those fellows have had the chance
of a fine start.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea which way they headed?”
asked Captain Harley.</p>

<p>“Which way is the wind?”</p>

<p>“North-east,” replied Ford.</p>

<p>“Then that’s the way they went. Their one idea
was to reach shore as soon as possible, and that’s the
way to do it.”</p>

<p>“I believe that you are right, Reuben,” responded
Pointer. “I move we get aboard of the Mary, and
steer in that direction.”</p>

<p>“I agree,” said Captain Harley.</p>

<p>Ford led the way at once to the cove in which the
boat lay at anchor. The sail was hoisted, and a quarter
of an hour after the party had found me we were
on the move.</p>

<p>“The question now is, which way did they go?”
said Ford, as he took the tiller. “Did they steer for
Hammer’s Point or Loadhead?”</p>

<p>“One is as near as another,” said Pointer.</p>

<p>“My idea is that they steered for some point between
the two places,” I ventured to suggest. “They
knew better than to sail right for any town on the lake;
for the news has spread, and they would be likely to
be captured as soon as they set foot on shore.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span></p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Captain Harley. “Most likely
they landed in the woods, and came into town by a
back way.”</p>

<p>“I advise that we look for the boat at a point
equally distant from both places,” I went on. “If
we can find the craft, we may get on the trail at
once.”</p>

<p>This was deemed the best thing to do, and Ford
changed the course accordingly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps they didn’t go to any town at all, but
struck the road for Chester,” said Pointer. “Of
course they wish to get away as far as possible.”</p>

<p>It took us all of an hour and a half to come within
easy sight of the north-east shore of Rock Island Lake.
We had hardly done so before Ford uttered a cry.</p>

<p>“That is where they landed! See, there is the
Catch Me now!”</p>

<p>Everybody looked, and we saw that he was right;
for there, in an inlet, was the sloop tied to a clump
of bushes. In two minutes we had reached the spot,
and jumped ashore.</p>

<p>“Here are the marks of their feet,” said Pointer;
“but see, they seem to spread out, as if the three of
them separated.”</p>

<p>“That was their intention,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Most likely. It is rarely that criminals keep
together after having committed a crime,” put in Captain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
Harley. “To hunt them down, we, too, will
have to divide into three parties.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I go to Hammer’s Point?” said the
constable.</p>

<p>“All right,” replied the captain. “I will go to
Loadhead, while you, Stone and Ford, can keep a
watch along the roads just beyond these woods.”</p>

<p>“I am willing,” I said.</p>

<p>“And so am I,” put in Ford.</p>

<p>“If either of you discover anything, report it to
Pointer or me at once.”</p>

<p>This we agreed to; and a moment later Ford and
I picked our way through the rank undergrowth to
the main road some two or three hundred feet beyond.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet a new hat that one of the chaps came
this way,” said my helper to me when we were some
distance on our way.</p>

<p>“What makes you think so?”</p>

<p>“Because the bushes are pushed aside in a number
of places.”</p>

<p>“That might have been done by a stray cow, Dan.”</p>

<p>“Cows don’t stray away as far as this,” he laughed.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not. Well, let us hope we are on the
right track.”</p>

<p>It did not take us long to reach the main road.
We looked up and down. Not a soul was in sight.</p>

<p>“I did not expect to see any one,” I said. “They
have several hours’ start of us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span></p>

<p>“Which way shall we go?”</p>

<p>“I hardly know. If I am not mistaken, there is
a farmhouse just beyond the bend. Let us ask for
information there.”</p>

<p>“By all means.”</p>

<p>It did not take us long to reach the place mentioned.
We found an old man hard at work in a field beside
the shed, which also stood near the road.</p>

<p>“Good-morning,” said I. “We would like a little
information.”</p>

<p>“Morning, young man. Well, what’s it ye want
to know?”</p>

<p>“Did you see or hear any one passing down the
road some time after three o’clock this morning?”</p>

<p>“Reckon I did, about four o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Did you see or hear the party?”</p>

<p>“Both, young man,” and Farmer Holden grinned.</p>

<p>“What time, please?”</p>

<p>“Close onto five o’clock. It was a tall, slim man.
He stopped at the shed just while I was milking the
cows.”</p>

<p>“A tall, slim man!” I cried. “And did he wear a
funny shaped hat?”</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon the hat was the first thing I
noticed,” was the reply. “It was the oddest thing
I had seen in these parts for quite a spell.”</p>

<p>“It must have been Mr. Norton!”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.<br>
<small>AT THE DEPOT.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“And who’s Mr. Norton?” asked the farmer curiously.</p>

<p>“One of the Bayport diamond robbers.”</p>

<p>“Gee-gopher! you don’t say!”</p>

<p>“Yes; what did he want?”</p>

<p>“Wanted to know the right road to Chester.”</p>

<p>“And did he set off in that direction?”</p>

<p>“He did. I reckon he wanted to make the morning
train for Philadelphia.”</p>

<p>“And when does that leave?”</p>

<p>“About ten o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Thank you. Come on, Ford. We have no time
to lose.”</p>

<p>And we hurried off, leaving Farmer Holden standing
by the fence, his mouth wide open with astonishment.</p>

<p>Chester was a large city, some five miles distant.
It was now half-past eight, so we had no time to
lose.</p>

<p>We walked rapidly. When about half the distance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
was covered a wagon came along, and we got a ride
for the balance of the way.</p>

<p>We jumped to the pavement as soon as we
reached the main street. Ford was in for going to
the depot, and so off we started.</p>

<p>A moment later, as we turned a corner, I was
nearly dumfounded to come face to face with Mr.
Norton, accompanied by Yates!</p>

<p>For one brief moment I was so taken aback that
I could neither move nor speak, and Ford seemed
to be in the same condition.</p>

<p>“Mr. Norton!” I finally gasped.</p>

<p>“Reuben!” he replied.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” demanded Yates.</p>

<p>He tried to act coolly, but it was not much of
a success.</p>

<p>“It means that we have come to Chester to have
you arrested,” put in Ford.</p>

<p>“Arrested!”</p>

<p>“Exactly; you must consider yourselves prisoners.”</p>

<p>And he called out at the top of his voice,—</p>

<p>“Police! police!”</p>

<p>“This will never do!” cried Mr. Norton. “I am
not to be captured in this fashion.”</p>

<p>And with a sudden bound he sprang around the
corner and darted away.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Yates tried to follow suit; but Ford’s
grip was a good one, and he held fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span></p>

<p>“Hang on to him, Dan!” I exclaimed. “Don’t
let him go. I am going after Mr. Norton!”</p>

<p>And not waiting to say more, I, too, dashed away.</p>

<p>Rounding the corner I saw my guardian fully a
block up the street, and running as fast as his long
legs would permit. I gave chase, and soon began
to close the distance between us.</p>

<p>The street was a narrow one, and but few people
were upon it. Had there been a crowd, I would
have had no trouble in getting some one to hold him.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton was a good runner, and he made the
best possible use of his time. He darted here and
there over a box and around a wagon, and it was no
mean job to keep him in sight.</p>

<p>The streets of Chester were comparatively strange
to me; but I believe they were also to him, so on
that score we were equal.</p>

<p>In a few moments he had crossed a river that ran
through the town. There was a drawbridge over it;
and no sooner had he passed than the keeper began
to open the draw for the purpose of allowing a
vessel to go through.</p>

<p>“Let me over!” I cried. “I am after a thief!”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t, young fellow!” was the grim
reply. “That is an old dodge.”</p>

<p>And the bridge-keeper continued to allow the
bridge to swing around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span></p>

<p>For an instant I paused in perplexity. What was
to be done? If I waited until the bridge was again
in position, Mr. Norton would surely escape me.</p>

<p>“I’ll venture it,” I muttered.</p>

<p>And stepping back, I rushed forward and cleared
the distance from the partly open draw to the opposite
shore at a bound.</p>

<p>“Hi! hi! none of that!” cried the keeper in
alarm; but I paid no heed.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton looked back to see what I would do.
He was no doubt quite dismayed to see me take
the jump.</p>

<p>I raised the cry of “Stop, thief!” but it did no
good, and made Mr. Norton run faster than ever.</p>

<p>We went along this way about three blocks, and
then he darted down a dark alley. I paused but
an instant, and then followed.</p>

<p>At the end was a high fence, and I entered just
in time to see him disappear over the top. I followed,
and found myself in the rear of a number of
greenhouses.</p>

<p>I looked around, but Mr. Norton was not to be
seen. There was a path between the glass houses,
and along this I picked my way as rapidly as possible,
satisfied that my guardian had passed on to
the front.</p>

<p>Suddenly I was confronted by a tall and fierce-looking
man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span></p>

<p>“Hey, what are you doin’ here?” he demanded
as he blocked my way.</p>

<p>“I am after a man that just jumped the back
fence,” I replied.</p>

<p>And I tried to hurry on.</p>

<p>“Hold on! not so fast!” he cried, catching me by
the shoulder. “How do I know but what you ain’t
one of them pesky flower thieves that’s been a-botherin’
me so long?”</p>

<p>“I am not a thief, sir!” I exclaimed. “But I
am after one, and every second counts. Didn’t you
see the man run through here just a moment ago?”</p>

<p>“’Pears to me maybe I did,” replied the florist
slowly. “Well, you can go; but don’t let me catch
you again, that’s all!”</p>

<p>And he shook his head decidedly.</p>

<p>Without waiting to reply I left, and made my way
to the street. I had lost several minutes arguing
with the man, and now Mr. Norton was out of
sight.</p>

<p>On the curbstone I paused, undecided which way
to proceed next.</p>

<p>“Looking for the man that run out of here?”
asked a boy who sat on a stoop near by whittling
a boat with a jackknife.</p>

<p>“I am,” I replied quickly. “Which way did he
go?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>“That way.” And the boy jerked his thumb in
the direction.</p>

<p>Suddenly an idea popped into my head.</p>

<p>“Is the depot in that direction?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>I was off as soon as the words were uttered. As
I ran I heard a train coming along at a lively rate;
and this proved a guide to the spot.</p>

<p>I ran into the depot, and took a hasty look
around. Mr. Norton was not there, and a glance
into the ladies’ room convinced me that he was
not in the building.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br>
<small>THE PURSUIT BECOMES PERILOUS.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I approached the ticket-office, and asked when
the train would leave for Philadelphia.</p>

<p>“In about five minutes,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“And is there any other train up or down before
that?”</p>

<p>“Only an express that does not stop.”</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>I walked out upon the platform, but managed to
keep out of sight as much as possible, fearful that
if Mr. Norton saw me he would leave the vicinity
at once.</p>

<p>I wished that I could run across a policeman to
whom I could state the case. But there seemed
to be none in the neighborhood; and an inquiry
brought forth the fact that the official on that post
had just gone off with a drunken man in charge.</p>

<p>Presently I heard the rumbling of an approaching
locomotive, and the next moment a train dashed
up and came to a halt.</p>

<p>As it did so I kept my eyes wide open, and saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
Mr. Norton dash from behind a neighboring building,
and make for the nearest car. I gave chase at
once, and caught him by the arm just as he was
about to mount the platform.</p>

<p>“Let me go!” he cried.</p>

<p>“No, sir; you sha’n’t escape me in this fashion,”
I returned.</p>

<p>For a moment he glared at me; then drawing
back his right arm he gave me a heavy blow directly
on the chin.</p>

<p>The crack made my teeth fairly rattle, and I
staggered back and rolled upon the platform.</p>

<p>“That will teach you a lesson, Reuben!” he exclaimed.
“Good-by! I never expect to see you
again.”</p>

<p>The train started off, and in a moment the first
two cars had passed me. I was dazed, and hardly
knew what to do.</p>

<p>Fortunately the train was a long one, and by the
time the last car was going by I had managed to
scramble to my feet. I made a dash for the rear
platform, and grabbed the iron rail with both hands.</p>

<p>The speed of the train was greater than I had
anticipated. The rush of wind took my breath
from me, and try as hard as I could I found it
impossible for me to raise myself from my highly
perilous position. The speed of the cars increased<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
every second, and it became more and more difficult
for me to retain my hold.</p>

<p>I shivered as I thought of what the consequence
would be if I allowed myself to drop. No doubt
I would be dashed to the track, and seriously
injured, if not killed.</p>

<p>My head soon began to whirl, and I felt that I
could not hang on for any great length of time.</p>

<p>While this thought rushed through my brain, the
door of the car opened and the conductor came out.
He saw at once what was up, and bending down,
he grasped me under the shoulder, and lifted me up
the steps and onto the platform.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by trying to get on the train
while we are running?” he demanded.</p>

<p>For a moment I could not answer, and in that
space of time he shoved me into the end of the car
and followed.</p>

<p>“There ought to be a law to arrest fellows like
you,” he went on. “If you had been killed I would
have been blamed for it!”</p>

<p>“It—it was necessary that I get aboard,” I gasped.</p>

<p>“How necessary? There is another train in half
an hour.”</p>

<p>“There is a man aboard this train I wanted to
catch.” I went on. “I don’t want him to get
away.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“Better let him go than lose your life,” returned
the conductor grimly.</p>

<p>“I didn’t think of that, sir. The man is a thief,
and is trying to get away from the police.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! Well, that alters the case a little, to
be sure. Who is he?”</p>

<p>“Mr. Norton.”</p>

<p>“What is he wanted for?”</p>

<p>“He is one of the men who stole the diamonds
from the Bayport bank.”</p>

<p>“Phew! you don’t say. You are sure?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. I was on hand when he got away.”</p>

<p>“You know the man?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; quite well.”</p>

<p>“And you say he is on this train?”</p>

<p>“He got aboard the forward car just as we left
Chester.”</p>

<p>“We will have to have him arrested.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would do so at the very next station,
sir. I don’t want to go to Philadelphia.”</p>

<p>“We will stop at Flanders, two miles farther on.
Come and identify the fellow.”</p>

<p>To this I agreed at once, and we started through
the train. As we passed each seat I gave the different
passengers a glance so as not to miss Mr. Norton
on the way.</p>

<p>As I did so, one fellow in the second car impressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
me strangely. He was a man about the build of
my guardian, but he wore a smoking-cap and a heavy
beard. I looked at him twice as we passed, and I
noticed him start as I did so.</p>

<p>At last we reached the forward car, and here I felt
sure that I would catch sight of Mr. Norton, but
I was mistaken. He was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>I was thoroughly puzzled, and the conductor saw
the look of dismay upon my face.</p>

<p>“Well, where is the man?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t see him,” I replied faintly.</p>

<p>“Maybe he has left the train.”</p>

<p>“Let me take another look.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead. We’ll have to pass Flanders, though.”</p>

<p>“And how far is the next station?”</p>

<p>“Landown, three miles.”</p>

<p>I started from the front platform and walked slowly
on to the very last. But I was again unsuccessful,
and so notified the conductor.</p>

<p>“If he was on, he must have jumped off when
you caught hold,” said that official.</p>

<p>I could not understand it. I was morally certain
that Mr. Norton was on the train. Had he in any
way disguised himself?</p>

<p>Suddenly I thought of the man who had impressed
me so strangely. I jumped to my feet.</p>

<p>“I think I know where he is!” I exclaimed.
“Please come with me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span></p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I think he is in disguise.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see,” returned the conductor of the train.</p>

<p>I led the way to the second car. The man with
the heavy beard sat looking out of the window. I
tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

<small>MR. NORTON’S ACCUSATION.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Mr. Norton!” I exclaimed as the man turned
around.</p>

<p>He started as if shot, then straightened up, and
looked at me coldly.</p>

<p>“My name is not Norton,” he replied in a low-pitched
tone. “My name is Edwards.”</p>

<p>“Scarcely,” I returned. “You are Mr. Enos Norton.”</p>

<p>“That is a cool assertion, young man.”</p>

<p>“Rather cool, but nevertheless true,” I replied
boldly; for his voice reassured me.</p>

<p>“Anybody would agree with me, I think, that a
man ought to know his own name best,” he replied
pompously.</p>

<p>“That is true, and you know your name is Norton.”</p>

<p>“Edwards, sir; Stephen Edwards from Newark.”</p>

<p>“Mighty queer the boy is so positive you are
somebody else,” put in the conductor.</p>

<p>“Evidently the boy is a fool,” puffed the man,
as he drew himself up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>“Yet I am not such a fool as to be deceived by
you,” I returned warmly.</p>

<p>“Easy there, boy, or I will hand you over to—”</p>

<p>“Rather say that I will do the handing over,”
I interrupted.</p>

<p>And to finish the farce, <a href="#i_frontis">I reached out and pulled
on the heavy beard.</a> It came off without much
trouble, and Mr. Norton was revealed to the gaze
of the half-dozen passengers who had listened to
our conversation.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by doing that?” he cried,
catching me by the arm.</p>

<p>There was quite a titter of laughter among the
people around.</p>

<p>“It means that I have exposed you,” I replied.
“This is Mr. Enos Norton,” I went on in a loud
voice. “He is wanted by the police at Bayport for
the robbery of some diamonds.”</p>

<p>This announcement created quite a stir.</p>

<p>“It’s a lie!” roared Mr. Norton. “I am a jeweler
from Newark.”</p>

<p>“What are you wearing a false beard for?” asked
the conductor.</p>

<p>“I—I suffer from face-ache, and use it to prevent
catching cold,” was the lame excuse, which
brought forth a laugh.</p>

<p>“I take it the boy is right,” said the conductor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
“We will hand you over to the police at Landown,”
and he pulled the cord to stop at the station which
we were just approaching.</p>

<p>“This is an outrage!”</p>

<p>“I’ll run the risk. It’s against the law to be disguised.”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton continued to bluster, but no one paid
any attention to him.</p>

<p>As soon as we had stopped at the railroad station
the station-master was informed of what had
happened. He brought forth a stout rope, and with
this my guardian’s wrists were bound, despite his
many protestations.</p>

<p>Then the train rolled on, leaving me on the platform.
Mr. Norton shook his fist in my face.</p>

<p>“You shall suffer for this, Reuben!” he cried. “You
will find it would have been better to have allowed
me to escape.”</p>

<p>A message was sent to the town constable and
he soon appeared. He was a pleasant man by the
name of Walters, and he said he would drive us
back to Chester at once. He made a search of Mr.
Norton’s clothing, and brought forth a carefully
wrapped bit of paper, containing his share of the
diamonds as they had been divided.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton gave a deep sigh as the constable put
the precious stones away where they would be safe;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
and he had very little to say as he walked away from
the depot and got into a wagon that was to take us
to Chester.</p>

<p>But on the way he grew more communicative, and
entered freely into conversation with the constable.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said finally. “I might as well own up.
I am guilty, and so are three others.”</p>

<p>“And who are the others?” asked Mr. Walters,
who knew but little about the case.</p>

<p>“Yates who was caught in Chester; a man named—well,
I won’t give you his right name; and this
boy here.”</p>

<p>“This boy!” cried the constable.</p>

<p>“I had nothing to do with it,” I put in warmly.</p>

<p>“But he did,” went on Mr. Norton. “Now that
he has seen to it that I am caught, I might as well
tell the whole story. He had as much to do with
it as any one.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t look like a bad boy,” ventured Mr.
Walters.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, he is, and a deep one too. Why,
he even stole one of the diamonds from the others
before we had a chance to divide them evenly.”</p>

<p>It made me feel pretty bad to have Mr. Norton
hurl his insinuations at me in this fashion. Should
he continue to do so, would I be able to make the
judge and the people at large think that I was entirely
innocent?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>“There is not one word of truth in what he says,”
I cried. “Mr. Walters, he is a thoroughly bad man;
and before his trial is over you will find it so.”</p>

<p>“I am not speaking in defense of myself,” said
Norton maliciously. “I know I have done wrong;
but it was only because this boy and his two friends
dragged me into it.”</p>

<p>I was nearly dumfounded by this audacious assertion,
but before I could utter a word Mr. Walters
broke in,—</p>

<p>“Funny if the boy is guilty he didn’t skip out
himself without trying to arrest you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s a deep one,” was Mr. Norton’s retort.
“He knew that to do so would make him appear
innocent. He has a long head on his shoulders.”</p>

<p>“Well, that ain’t here or there. I’ll take you both
along.”</p>

<p>After this there was a long spell of silence. I was
busy thinking over what my guardian had said, and
wondering what would be the outcome of his capture.</p>

<p>On reaching Chester, we drove at once to the
police station. As we alighted at the door, Ford
came forth.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” he cried. “Well, this is lucky! I was
just going back to Loadhead to see if they had
captured Avery. So you’ve got him?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Where is Yates?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span></p>

<p>“The chief is getting ready to take him to Bayport.”</p>

<p>“Then he can take this man, and also the boy,”
said Mr. Walters.</p>

<p>“Certainly the man, but why the boy?” asked Ford.</p>

<p>“The man accuses him of being an accomplice.”</p>

<p>“Accuses Reuben!” burst out Ford. “There is
not a word of truth in it! Why, that man tried to
burn the boy up!”</p>

<p>Walters shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>“I must listen to what he says. Come, here is
Chief Larkins now.”</p>

<p>In a moment more we were all in the station-house;
and I told how Mr. Norton had been captured;
and Mr. Walters gave his knowledge of the
event. Then Yates was brought in, and the diamonds
that had been found upon the two were put
in a safe place until they could be returned to Bayport.</p>

<p>“Is this boy an accomplice of yours?” asked the
chief of Yates.</p>

<p>“I have nothing to say,” growled the man.</p>

<p>And I found out later that such was the only
reply he had made since he had been captured.</p>

<p>“Of course the boy’s in the case,” said Mr. Norton.
“He’s my nephew.”</p>

<p>“Are you?” asked Chief Larkins.</p>

<p>“I am; but the relationship doesn’t count for much.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>“I am his guardian, though he doesn’t seem to
appreciate that fact.”</p>

<p>“You are not a guardian for any boy to be proud
of,” put in Mr. Walters.</p>

<p>“He isn’t my guardian any longer. I have known
him only a week, and I have found him to be a
thoroughly bad man. I want nothing to do with
him.”</p>

<p>There was considerable talk after this; and it was
finally decided to return to Bayport without delay,
stopping at Loadhead on the way in order to find
out if Avery had been captured.</p>

<small>NORTON BIXBY.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Chief Larkins procured a large wagon, and into
this the entire party were stowed away, and off we
drove.</p>

<p>“Did you have much trouble with Yates?” I asked
of Ford, as we rolled along.</p>

<p>“A little; but I showed him that I was a pretty
strong fellow, and then he gave in at once.”</p>

<p>It did not take us long to reach Loadhead. Here
we found both Captain Harley and Captain Pointer.
Nothing had been seen of Avery, but they felt confident
that he would be captured in some town on
the other side of the mountains.</p>

<p>“How shall we get back to Bayport?” asked the
constable.</p>

<p>“Why not use the Catch Me?” I replied. “I
suppose she is lying right where we left her.”</p>

<p>This was agreed to, and we made for the shore
of Rock Island Lake without delay.</p>

<p>To our astonishment the Catch Me was gone!</p>

<p>What did it mean? I gazed about in perplexity.
Suddenly Constable Pointer gave a shout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span></p>

<p>“That explains it! Avery came back and took
the boat! I’ll bet he landed at some other point
where he thought he would be free from pursuit!”</p>

<p>“I think you are right,” replied Captain Harley.
“We must take the Mary and look for him.”</p>

<p>This was agreed to; and they left the rest of us
to return to Bayport. I trusted they would succeed
in their mission, not only for the sake of capturing
the robber, but also that my beautiful sloop might
be returned to me.</p>

<p>It took us quite a while to secure another craft
in the vicinity. However, we at length hailed a fishing-sloop,
and the owner agreed to take us down
the lake provided we would put up with such accommodations
as his boat afforded.</p>

<p>“Good enough,” said Chief Larkins. “The main
thing is to get there.”</p>

<p>“I was never treated so meanly in all my life,”
growled Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>“You’ll see worse, I reckon,” was the reply. “A
man that steals shouldn’t look for any comfort in
this life.”</p>

<p>“I would never have done it if the boy hadn’t
put me up to it.”</p>

<p>“More shame to you if instead of being led you
didn’t lead, that’s all I’ve got to say.”</p>

<p>And the police official turned away in disgust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span></p>

<p>“You don’t believe me guilty?” I asked earnestly.</p>

<p>“You don’t look it,” he replied. “If you are innocent
I trust you will have an easy time proving it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that. A diamond was
found upon my person; but I am willing to swear
I found the stone and did not steal it.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why the man accuses you if you are
not guilty.”</p>

<p>“He is angry because I captured him.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see. Well, capturing him ought to be a
deed much in your favor.”</p>

<p>We were soon underway. It was a clear, bright
day and the breeze was strong. Of course we had
to tack, and this made the trip a slow one; but we
spent a good half-hour in dining upon some fish
which Ford and I broiled in the cuddy, and of
which all hands partook.</p>

<p>It was well on in the afternoon when we struck
the dock at Bayport. While we were landing quite
a crowd gathered, and the news was soon circulated
that two of the robbers had been captured.</p>

<p>A perfect mob of people followed us up to the
court-house, and a goodly number entered the room
where Judge Green sat deeply interested over some
legal documents.</p>

<p>“What is this I hear?” he exclaimed as the party
entered. “Two of the robbers captured! Good! it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
is glorious news! So this is the man called Yates, and
this is Norton. Well, gentlemen, what have you to
say for yourselves?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” replied Yates.</p>

<p>“That’s better than telling a falsehood,” said the
judge. “So your breaking jail didn’t do you any
good,” he added, turning to Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>“It is all a mistake,” whined my guardian.</p>

<p>“So it would seem, sir.”</p>

<p>And the fat judge laughed at what he thought
was a good joke.</p>

<p>In a little while the court was called to order,
and the prisoners were granted a hearing. Ford and
I were the principal witnesses, and we were listened
to with close attention.</p>

<p>“Well, Stone, I think you had some remarkable
adventures on Rock Island,” said Judge Green, after
I had finished. “You came very near losing your
life, if what you say is true.”</p>

<p>“I have told everything exactly as it occurred.”</p>

<p>“Then these men have an account to settle outside
of the robbery. It is no light offense to treat
anybody as you have been treated.”</p>

<p>“Besides that, they stole my boat,” I added.</p>

<p>“Yes; that is true.”</p>

<p>“I trust you don’t think I am guilty, sir.”</p>

<p>“About that it is not my place to say. Squire<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
Slocum has let you out on bail. Remember you are
innocent until proven guilty, as is the case with
every one brought before the bar of justice.”</p>

<p>“And when do you suppose the case will come to
trial?”</p>

<p>“That will depend upon whether the other robber
is captured or not. It will probably be tried at this
term of court.”</p>

<p>While the judge and I were conversing, a gentleman
entered the room and pushed his way to my
side. It was Mr. Markham, and he shook me warmly
by the hand.</p>

<p>“I have heard what you have done, Stone,” he
said. “Allow me to congratulate you.”</p>

<p>Then his eyes ran over those gathered around and
rested upon Mr. Norton.</p>

<p>“Hullo, Norton Bixby, where did you come from?”
he demanded. “I thought you were in the New
York State Penitentiary.”</p>

<p>I listened in amazement.</p>

<p>What did Mr. Markham mean by addressing Mr.
Norton as Norton Bixby? To me it was an intensely
interesting question, and I sprang forward
before the latter could reply to the question that
had been propounded.</p>

<p>“Is this man not Mr. Enos Norton?” I asked
breathlessly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span></p>

<p>“Enos Norton,” repeated Mr. Markham. “Why,
no. His name is Bixby, Norton Bixby, and I had
him arrested three years ago in New York for stealing
some unregistered bonds from my office.”</p>

<p>I fell back in astonishment.</p>

<small>A LUCKY FIND.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“If his name is Bixby he cannot be my uncle,” I
gasped.</p>

<p>“What is your uncle’s name?”</p>

<p>“Enos Norton.”</p>

<p>“There is a similarity in names, but I guess he is
not the man.”</p>

<p>I breathed a sigh of relief. The news was worth
more than a thousand dollars to me.</p>

<p>“Then he is some first-class fraud,” I went on;
“for he came to Bend Center about a week ago,
and pretended to be my uncle, and said that my father
had appointed him as my guardian.”</p>

<p>“That is very odd,” observed Judge Green gravely.
“This matter must be looked into. You are positive
this man is Norton Bixby?” he continued, to Mr.
Markham.</p>

<p>“I am. His face is one not easily forgotten. But
I thought his term was not up for some time yet.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he was let out for good behavior,” suggested
Captain Harley. “They often shorten their
time for that reason, you know.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span></p>

<p>“So I understand. How about this, Bixby?”</p>

<p>And he turned to my pretended guardian.</p>

<p>Mr. Norton, as I shall continue to call him for the
present, pressed his mouth together tightly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know you,” he snapped.</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“I say I don’t know you.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to deny that you are Norton Bixby?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do.”</p>

<p>“I can prove it to be true, sir,” returned Mr. Markham
with energy.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>Mr. Norton asked the question coolly, and I saw
that the city gentleman was nonplused.</p>

<p>“We will see later,” he returned, and then spoke
to the judge in a low tone.</p>

<p>“I am Enos Norton, and this boy’s uncle,” went
on my pretended guardian. “This man and the boy,
who is a bad egg, have hatched up this scheme
against me.”</p>

<p>“We will find out the truth of the matter at the
trial, or before,” said Judge Green. “In the meanwhile,
Oldman, remove the prisoners, and see to it
that neither of them gets away. You, Stone, I will
let go on the bail furnished to Squire Slocum. I
suppose you can be found at your mill whenever
wanted?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir; either there or somewhere in the vicinity.
Dan Ford will be able to tell where I am at any
time.”</p>

<p>“That will do then. Mr. Markham, I will consult
with you later. Will you dine with me this evening?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure, Judge,” was the reply.</p>

<p>A little later the hearing was brought to a close,
and Mr. Norton and Yates were led away. The
police authorities remained in Bayport to await the
return of those who had gone in search of Avery.
Ford and I went down to the dock and hired a man
to take us over to the Bend.</p>

<p>“I would like to know just how much this Carney
had to do with the affair,” I said as we were
crossing.</p>

<p>“Not much, I guess,” returned Ford. “He is an
awfully ignorant fellow, and merely did what was
told him in the shape of sailing the men where they
wanted to go.”</p>

<p>“I am inclined to think that way, Dan. But you
can’t always tell about these matters. I trust that
they will catch Avery and get back the Catch Me,”
I continued. “I wouldn’t have that boat injured for
a good deal.”</p>

<p>“No; she is too fine a craft for that.”</p>

<p>At the Bend, Ford and I separated; and I hastened<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
along the road to the mill to assure myself
that nothing had occurred during my absence.</p>

<p>As I hurried on, I thought over the way Mr. Norton
had acted since he had come to the Bend, and
I could not believe but that Mr. Markham was
right, and that he was not my uncle at all.</p>

<p>This thought gave me much satisfaction, but there
was a great deal in it to worry me.</p>

<p>If Mr. Norton was an impostor, what of the letter
he had written to me concerning my father’s
death? Had my parent met his end in the manner
described, or was it possible that my dear father was
alive?</p>

<p>Fervently I prayed that such might be the fact,
that my father might some day come back to me.
The prayer brought a hope, and I walked along with
a lighter tread after I had uttered it.</p>

<p>Presently I passed the spot where Ford and I had
captured Carney. The remembrance of the occurrence
brought to mind Mr. Norton’s valise and the
letters that had been missing from it. In the rush
of other events, this had slipped my mind; but now
I determined to make a search for the documents.</p>

<p>I found the exact spot where Carney’s boat had
been beached, and soon discovered his footprints in
the soil near by.</p>

<p>I had hardly got thus far, when I saw something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
white on the ground just ahead. I rushed forward,
and in a moment held in my hand the precious letters
for which I was seeking.</p>

<p>They were three in number, and bound around
with an elastic. Why Carney had thrown them
away without looking in them, I did not know; but
later on found out that he could not read.</p>

<p>I hastily opened one of the letters. It was short,
and ran as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">New York, June 6.</span></p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Dear Bixby</span>,—<br></p>

<p>Will be on hand in Chicago as soon as I can arrange with
Avery. He will meet us at Bayport when desired.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Martin Yates.</span><br></p>
</div>

<p>The second letter was of more importance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bayport, July 23.</span></p>

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Dear Bixby</span>,—<br></p>

<p>Avery and I are here awaiting you. So are the diamonds.
Why fool with that boy, even though his father is dead! If you
try to impersonate his uncle, even though he was your cousin, you
may get into trouble, and I cannot see how it is going to benefit
us much, except to afford some kind of a hiding-place if we get
in a tight fix. Will be near the mill when wanted.</p>

<p class="right">M. Y.<br></p>
</div>

<p>As I read this letter the tears sprang into my
eyes. Then my father was really dead! It was a
cruel thought, and one that so unnerved me that I
could hardly read the third communication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noi"><span class="smcap">Bixby</span>,—<br></p>

<p>All is ready for the final move. Destroy this letter, so if
you get caught we will not be known. I think you acted like
a fool in going to the mill at all, there was so little money in
the scheme; but you always were a queer stick. I intend to
impersonate the boy during the evening. I have one of his old
coats, also his cap. It will mix matters up and be the better for
us. Carney does what he is told and don’t know any better.
Watch Avery. He is rather soft and may back out. That boy
is no fool, and if you get your fingers burnt it will be your own
fault.</p>

<p class="right">M. Y.<br></p>
</div>

<p>I folded up the letters and put them into my pocket.
I had learned much from them. Norton Bixby was
my real uncle’s cousin; Yates had done me the injury
of appearing in my coat during the evening at Bayport,
and raised the impression that I was in town;
and my father was no more.</p>

<p>I continued on my way slowly. So absorbed was
I, that when I approached the mill I did not notice a
stranger standing by the door, and when he spoke to
me I started at his voice.</p>

<p>“Is this the Stones’ mill?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” I replied; “and I am Reuben Stone.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” He looked at me in a kindly way.
“Give me your hand,” he went on; “I am your
uncle, Enos Norton, just arrived from the West.”</p>

<small>A WELCOME ARRIVAL.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>I could hardly believe the evidence of my senses.
This tall, well-dressed gentleman my uncle! It was
welcome news indeed.</p>

<p>“You are my uncle?” I repeated slowly.</p>

<p>“Yes. I haven’t been to the Bend in years; but
you must have heard of me, Reuben?”</p>

<p>“I have heard of you. But—but”—</p>

<p>“Where is your father?”</p>

<p>“Father is dead.”</p>

<p>“What! dead! and I never heard of it! How
long since?”</p>

<p>“Several weeks, I believe. I am not sure, sir.”</p>

<p>“Not sure? Did he not die here?”</p>

<p>“No, sir; he died in South Dakota, where he went
to hunt for some good spot to locate a mill.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is indeed news. I wish I had heard of
it before. I just came from Chicago.”</p>

<p>“While you were there did you meet Norton
Bixby?” I asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes. But how do you know that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p>“He is here now, under arrest.”</p>

<p>“Indeed. Norton, I know, is a bad fellow. He is
a second cousin on the Norton side.”</p>

<p>“He came to the mill and introduced himself as
Enos Norton, and said he had been appointed my
guardian by my father, who had lost his life by falling
over a ravine. Now he is in jail for the robbery
of a number of diamonds.”</p>

<p>“The rascal! I know he has been in jail before in
New York State. So he pretended to be myself. Reuben,
you did not think much of your uncle, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I must say I did not.”</p>

<p>“I think you will find me a different sort of fellow.
I just arrived on the stage-coach, and the driver did
not tell me any of the news. I thought it rather
queer to find the mill deserted, and was just on the
point of starting for the Bend when you came along.”</p>

<p>I invited my real Uncle Norton into the mill at
once, and as he said he was somewhat hungry, I
bustled around to get supper, meanwhile telling him
of all that had occurred.</p>

<p>“It sounds like a perfect romance,” he said, when
I had finished. “I never dreamed that Nort would
dare to do such a thing. I remember that he asked
me much about the Bend; but I thought it was
only through curiosity. On the last day he was with
me he borrowed twenty dollars.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span></p>

<p>“Didn’t he know you might turn up here?”</p>

<p>“Probably not. At the time we were together I
was planning to go to New Mexico. He, no doubt,
thinks I am there at this moment.”</p>

<p>“He’ll be surprised to see you.”</p>

<p>“No doubt. But such a thorough rascal as he
has proved himself to be is better in jail than out
of it.”</p>

<p>I soon had supper prepared, and my uncle sat
down and ate heartily. I could not touch a mouthful.
The rapid turning of affairs had completely
unsettled me.</p>

<p>“We must have a talk with Nort to-morrow, and
find out all the particulars of your father’s death,”
went on my real uncle. “I am not at all satisfied
with the story he has told to you. If I remember
rightly your father was a very careful man.”</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, and then changed the subject,
asking me how I got along at the mill, and
if business was good.</p>

<p>“I came partly to offer your father an interest
in a ranch I am on the point of buying in New
Mexico,” he said, when I had related how matters
stood. “I know the Bend is a dull place, and I
have got an opening where I think you would do
very well.”</p>

<p>“I would be glad to leave the Bend,” I replied.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
“I think I could do better in some new and lively
place.”</p>

<p>My uncle gave a laugh.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as a ranch is such a lively place;
but it will give you a chance to make money.”</p>

<p>“Then that’s lively enough for me,” I returned.</p>

<p>We spent the evening in getting acquainted. I
found Mr. Norton a splendid, whole-souled man, and
took to him immediately; and I was glad to note
that this feeling seemed to be reciprocated.</p>

<p>On the following morning we started for Bend
Center at an early hour. Almost the first person
we met was Constable Pointer, who had just come
over from Bayport.</p>

<p>“What luck?” I asked.</p>

<p>“We’ve got the diamonds!” he replied; “and
the Catch Me too.”</p>

<p>“You mean that you didn’t catch Avery?”</p>

<p>“We caught him, but he gave Captain Harley the
slip in Loadhead. We hope to get him to-day.”</p>

<p>But I may as well add right here that Avery was
never captured, nor was he ever heard from after
that day.</p>

<p>I introduced my uncle to Pointer, and also to
Ford, who came up while we were talking. The
mill-hand was highly pleased as well as astonished
to meet the stranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span></p>

<p>“Good fellow, I guess,” he whispered to me.
“Beats the bogus Norton all to bits!”</p>

<p>“You are right, Dan,” I returned.</p>

<p>It did not take my real uncle long to pick up
some old acquaintances, who soon recognized him.
All wondered that they had been deceived, and they
attributed it to the similar family appearance that
was common to both men.</p>

<p>Then we sailed over to Bayport, and made our
way to the court-house. Judge Green was not yet
present; but when the matter was explained, the
jailer readily consented to allow Mr. Norton to interview
the prisoner who had so misrepresented himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.<br>
<small>A HAPPY ENDING.</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It will be needless to dwell upon Bixby’s astonishment
when confronted by my uncle. He turned
all sorts of colors.</p>

<p>“I—I thought you were in New Mexico!” he
gasped.</p>

<p>“I am glad I am not,” was my uncle’s reply.
“Now, Nort, I want you to make a clean breast
of this whole matter.”</p>

<p>“Will you help me in my case if I do?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I certainly won’t help you if you don’t,” was
the reply. “Tell me all; and I will see to it that
you have a lawyer when your case comes to trial.”</p>

<p>On the strength of this promise Norton Bixby
told his story. It is too long to repeat here, but
in substance was as follows:—</p>

<p>After leaving the New York penitentiary he had
gone West, and there fallen in with my father, and
with him gone to South Dakota, getting my parent
to pay the expenses. My father had really fallen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
over a ravine, and lay at the bottom dead. Bixby
had run from the spot in horror, and had never
gone near the corpse again.</p>

<p>When he got back to Chicago he noticed my
uncle’s arrival at one of the hotels through the
newspapers, and he at once called upon him. Then
came a letter from Yates, asking him to take a
hand in the Bayport robbery; and knowing that Bayport
was close to Bend Center, he had concocted
the scheme to appear upon the scene as my uncle
and guardian. There was not much to be gained
by it; but the idea had fascinated him, and he had
carried it out as is known.</p>

<p>“I was sure Enos had no intention of coming
here,” he finished; “but I was mistaken.”</p>

<p>“It is funny I didn’t get any word from my
father during the time you were with him.”</p>

<p>“He said he wasn’t going to write until he had
good news. He was afraid of disheartening you.”</p>

<p>“And you never went back to bury him?” I
went on, with a quiver in my voice.</p>

<p>“No, I couldn’t. When he went over, he let out
a scream that seemed to freeze the very marrow in
my bones. For a moment I couldn’t move. At
last I looked over the edge of the rocks, and I
saw he was all crushed and bruised.”</p>

<p>“But he must have been alive.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span></p>

<p>“Not much. That fall was all of a hundred feet
and on the bare rocks. I would have gone down;
but it was such a lonely spot I got frightened, and
simply ran away as hard as I could. That’s the
plain truth.”</p>

<p>And Norton Bixby wiped the cold perspiration
from his forehead.</p>

<p>I looked the man in the eyes, and could not help
believe that in this particular the fellow spoke the
truth.</p>

<p>But in my heart how I wished he had returned
and made sure that my father was really dead!
There might have been a spark of life remaining, and
if so, prompt treatment might have given him back
to me.</p>

<p>I bowed my head, and the tears began to well
up in my eyes. Norton Bixby saw them, and turned
away his head.</p>

<p>Then the jailer appeared.</p>

<p>“A man up-stairs wants to see you at once,” he
said to me.</p>

<p>“Who is it?” I asked, drying my eyes.</p>

<p>“Didn’t give any name, sir.”</p>

<p>I went up to the court room. The man who
wished to see me was standing near the door. I
gave one look, paused to make sure that <a href="#i_fp256">I was not
dreaming, and then rushed forward and threw myself
into his arms.</a></p>

<figure class="figcenter" id="i_fp256">
  <a href="#Page_256"><img src="images/i_fp256.jpg"
       alt="I was not dreaming, and then rushed forward and

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span></p>

<p>The new-comer was my father.</p>

<p>“Father!”</p>

<p>It was the only word I could utter; but how much
it told!</p>

<p>“Reuben!” he replied.</p>

<p>“I thought you were dead,” I went on, after a
long embrace. “Norton Bixby said so.”</p>

<p>“I have been very near to death,” my father
answered. “You have heard how I fell from the
top of a ravine to the bottom?”</p>

<p>“Yes; Bixby just told the story.”</p>

<p>“Well, I must have lain there for a long time
unconscious; for when I went down the sun was
still shining, and when I came to all was dark.”</p>

<p>“And you were not hurt?”</p>

<p>“Indeed I was. My left ankle was broken, and
something was wrong in my chest, not to say anything
of the scratches I received, which covered my
face and hands with blood.”</p>

<p>“And how did you escape?”</p>

<p>“It is a long story. When I regained consciousness,
I could not walk; and it was hard work to
crawl to the water to get a drink and bathe my ankle.
I tried to call out; but the pain was too great in my
chest.”</p>

<p>“And you were all alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and for three days. The pain was something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
terrible; and that, added to the loneliness of
my position, gave me a fever, and I lost my mind.”</p>

<p>“And who rescued you?”</p>

<p>“A hunter named Thompson, and two others.
They told me two weeks after, when I was recovering,
that they had found me delirious near their
camp, and had taken me in and sent off for a doctor.
They could not find out who I was, and had done
the best they could for me.”</p>

<p>“And then you came on?”</p>

<p>“Yes, after writing you a letter”—</p>

<p>“I never received it,” I put in quickly.</p>

<p>“So I heard at the Bend this morning. Oh, my
son, I cannot tell you how glad I am to be back
with you once more!”</p>

<p>“And I am glad, too, father,” I replied. “I trust
we may never be separated again.”</p>

<p>We shook hands warmly, and a moment later my
uncle appeared.</p>

<p>He was greatly astonished, but glad indeed to know
that my father had had such a marvelous escape.
Then Mr. Markham and Judge Green arrived, and all
the stories were told over again.</p>

<p>Later on my father went down to see Norton Bixby.
I do not know what took place at the interview,
but I think it must have done Bixby much good,
for ever after that he seemed a better man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span></p>

<p>When court was called, Norton Bixby and Yates
were bound over to await the action of the grand
jury. As soon as this was done my uncle invited
us all to dine at the hotel at his expense, and among
the party were Mr. Markham and Ford. The latter
nearly wrung my father’s hand off when they met.</p>

<p>After we had satisfied the inner man, my uncle
unfolded his plans to my father. Mr. Markham became
interested, and as a consequence, the original
plan was much enlarged. My father agreed to sell
off his mill property as soon as it could be done,
and then the three were to purchase a large tract of
land, and form a company for the purpose of raising
cattle. I may as well add that Ford was promised
a job as soon as all arrangements could be made.</p>

<p>The dinner mentioned above took place just six
years ago. During the intervening time great changes
have taken place. Norton Bixby and Yates were both
sent to prison, the former for two and the latter for
eight years. During that time Yates tried to escape,
and as a consequence is still behind the bars.</p>

<p>Bixby came out four years ago. He has changed
for the better, and is a good man on the ranch,
where he is well away from the temptations of the
city. Carney was given a year in the penitentiary,
and I don’t know what has become of him.</p>

<p>The mill and the Catch Me were sold at good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
prices, and then my father and I moved out to our
new home. We have with us my uncle and Dan
Ford, and we are not only happy, but we are likewise
getting rich.</p>

<p>Mr. Markham and his family pay us a visit once
a year, and he has not forgotten the promise made
to further benefit me; for on my twenty-first birthday
he presented me, in the name of his wife and
son, with an eighth interest in the ranch, worth, at
the lowest calculation, ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>I like my new home a hundred times better than
the old. Here I am free from the sneers of all such
men as Mr. James Jackson, and I have the satisfaction
of knowing that my work is going to accomplish
something. I have a swift pony, a fine dog,
and a good gun; I love my occupation—and all these
things being so, what more is there to say but to
bid my readers adieu?</p>

<p>“In ‘Richard Dare’s Venture,’ Edward Stratemeyer has fully sustained his reputation
as an entertaining, helpful, and instructive writer for boys.”—<cite>Philadelphia
Call.</cite></p>

<p>“‘Richard Dare’s Venture,’ by Edward Stratemeyer, tells the story of a country
lad who goes to New York to earn enough to support his widowed mother and
orphaned sisters. Richard’s energy, uprightness of character, and good sense carry
him through some trying experiences, and gain him friends.”—<cite>The Churchman</cite>,
New York.</p>

<p>“A breezy boy’s book is ‘Oliver Bright’s Search.’ The author has a direct, graphic
style, and every healthy minded youth will enjoy the volume.”—<cite>N. Y. Commercial
Advertiser.</cite></p>

<p>“‘Richard Dare’s Venture’ is a fresh, wholesome book to put into a boy’s hands.”—<cite>St.
Louis Post Dispatch.</cite></p>

<p>“‘Richard Dare’s Venture’ is a wholesome story of a practical boy who made a
way for himself when thrown upon his own resources.”—<cite>Christian Advocate.</cite></p>

<p>“It is such books as ‘Richard Dare’s Venture’ that are calculated to inspire
young readers with a determination to succeed in life, and to choose some honorable
walk in which to find that success. The author, Edward Stratemeyer, has shown a
judgment that is altogether too rare in the makers of books for boys, in that he has
avoided that sort of heroics in the picturing of the life of his hero which deals in
adventures of the daredevil sort. In that respect alone the book commends itself to
the favor of parents who have a regard for the education of their sons, but the story
is sufficiently enlivening and often thrilling to satisfy the healthful desires of the
young reader.”—<cite>Kansas City Star.</cite></p>

<p>“Of standard writers of boys’ stories there is quite a list, but those who have not
read any by Edward Stratemeyer have missed a very goodly thing.”—<cite>Boston Ideas.</cite></p>

<p>“Mr. Edward Stratemeyer is in danger of becoming very popular among the
young people of the country.”—<cite>Burlington</cite> (Iowa) <cite>Hawk-eye</cite>.</p>

<p>“‘The Last Cruise of the Spitfire’ is of deep interest to the bounding heart of an
enthusiastic boy. The book leaves a good impression on a boy’s mind, as it teaches
the triumph of noble deeds and true heroism.”—<cite>Kansas City</cite> (Mo.) <cite>Times</cite>.</p>

<p>“Let us mention in passing two admirable books for boys, ‘Reuben Stone’s Discovery’
and ‘Oliver Bright’s Search,’ by Edward Stratemeyer, with whom we are
all acquainted. This last bit of his work is especially good, and the boy who gets
one of these volumes will become very popular among his fellows until the book is
worn threadbare.”—<cite>N.Y. Herald.</cite></p>

<p>“A good sea-tale for boys is ‘The Last Cruise of the Spitfire,’ by Edward Stratemeyer.
There is plenty of adventure in it, a shipwreck, a cruise on a raft, and other
stirring perils of the deep.”—<cite>Detroit</cite> (Mich.) <cite>Journal</cite>.</p>

<p>“In a simple, plain, straightforward manner, Mr. Edward Stratemeyer endeavors
to show his boy readers what persistency, honesty, and willingness to work have
accomplished for his young hero, and his moral is evident. Mr. Stratemeyer is very
earnest and sincere in his portraiture of young character beginning to shape itself to
weather against the future. A book of this sort is calculated to interest boys, to feed
their ambition with hope, and to indicate how they must fortify themselves against
the wiles of vice.”—<cite>Boston Herald.</cite></p>

<p>No author has come before the public during the present generation who
has achieved a larger and more deserving popularity among young people than
“Oliver Optic.” His stories have been very numerous, but they have been
uniformly excellent in moral tone and literary quality. As indicated in the
general title, it is the author’s intention to conduct the readers of this entertaining
series “around the world.” As a means to this end, the hero of the
story purchases a steamer which he names the “Guardian Mother,” and
with a number of guests she proceeds on her voyage.—<cite>Christian Work, N. Y.</cite></p>

<p>Amid such new and varied surroundings it would be surprising indeed if the
author, with his faculty of making even the commonplace attractive, did not
tell an intensely interesting story of adventure, as well as give much information

the strange peoples with whom they are brought in contact. This book, and
indeed the whole series, is admirably adapted to reading aloud in the family
circle, each volume containing matter which will interest all the members of

<p>“There never has been a more interesting writer in the field of juvenile
literature than Mr. <span class="smcap">W. T. Adams</span>, who, under his well-known pseudonym, is
known and admired by every boy and girl in the country, and by thousands
who have long since passed the boundaries of youth, yet who remember with
pleasure the genial, interesting pen that did so much to interest, instruct, and
entertain their younger years. ‘The Blue and the Gray’ is a title that is sufficiently
indicative of the nature and spirit of the latest series, while the name
of <span class="smcap">Oliver Optic</span> is sufficient warrant of the absorbing style of narrative. This
series is as bright and entertaining as any work that Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span> has yet put
forth, and will be as eagerly perused as any that has borne his name. It would
not be fair to the prospective reader to deprive him of the zest which comes
from the unexpected by entering into a synopsis of the story. A word, however,
should be said in regard to the beauty and appropriateness of the binding,
which makes it a most attractive volume.”—<cite>Boston Budget.</cite></p>

<p>“Though we are not so young as we once were, we relished these stories

<p>“Mr. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>, the celebrated and popular writer, familiarly known as <span class="smcap">Oliver

life; and, notwithstanding he has written scores of books, the same freshness

predominates. Perhaps it does. But a book for young people needs this, and
so long as good sentiments are inculcated such books ought to be read.”</p>

<div class="citefont">

<p>“This series of six volumes recounts the adventures of two brothers, Tom
and Jack Somers, one in the army, the other in the navy, in the great Civil War.
The romantic narratives of the fortunes and exploits of the brothers are thrilling
in the extreme. Historical accuracy in the recital of the great events of
that period is strictly followed, and the result is, not only a library of entertaining
volumes, but also the best history of the Civil War for young people ever
written.”</p>

appearing in the different volumes as a farmer, a captain, a bookkeeper, a
soldier, a sailor, and a traveller. In all of them the hero meets with very
exciting adventures, told in the graphic style for which the author is famous.”</p>

one of the best to be found in this or any past age. Troops of young people
hang over his vivid pages; and not one of them ever learned to be mean, ignoble,
cowardly, selfish, or to yield to any vice from anything they ever read from his
pen.”—<cite>Providence Press.</cite></p>

<p>“The story from its inception, and through the twelve volumes (see Second
Series), is a bewitching one, while the information imparted concerning the
countries of Europe and the isles of the sea is not only correct in every particular,
but is told in a captivating style. <span class="smcap">Oliver Optic</span> will continue to be the
boys’ friend, and his pleasant books will continue to be read by thousands of
American boys. What a fine holiday present either or both series of ‘Young
America Abroad’ would be for a young friend! It would make a little library
highly prized by the recipient, and would not be an expensive one.”—<cite>Providence

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oliver Optic</span> is a <i lang="fr">nom de plume</i> that is known and loved by almost every
boy of intelligence in the land. We have seen a highly intellectual and world-weary
man, a cynic whose heart was somewhat embittered by its large experience
of human nature, take up one of <span class="smcap">Oliver Optic’s</span> books, and read it at a
sitting, neglecting his work in yielding to the fascination of the pages. When
a mature and exceedingly well-informed mind, long despoiled of all its freshness,
can thus find pleasure in a book for boys, no additional words of recommendation
are needed.”—<cite>Sunday Times.</cite></p>
